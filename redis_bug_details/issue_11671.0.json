  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nUsing `hrandfield` in the following way hangs the server. Other clients are then not able to connect to the server and get any response, potentially leading to DoS.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nRun the following commands in the cli with the server running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhmset myhash a 1\r\nhrandfield myhash -9223372036854770000\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nReturns an error code or a result, instead of hanging.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nTested on:\r\n```\r\nUbuntu 22.04.1 LTS\r\nRedis ver: built from commit af0a4fe20771603f0eab75a1f60748d124cf33c3\r\n```",

I agree that we can discuss these crashes together if they share the same root cause, but I may not have time to make a PR for them. At a glance, some of them are triggered by an abort and others are triggered by segfaults, and for this issue we are looking at right now, it's also related to a 'large' number, which I thought could all be (potentially) prevented by putting precondition checks for these commands (to restrict the maxsize of memory allocation.)

We might need other heuristics to abort such operations."
