This issue was seen only once.\r\n\r\nanything special about the system on which it runs?\r\n>> It is a typical 4 core intel x86 CPU powered network switch. The redis DB is being used to store network traffic counters collected from the hardware. The redis-server is running inside a Debian 10 container running on top of a Debian10 host o/s.\r\n\r\nthe redis binary the one supplied by the OS?\r\n>> Yes. The redis-server package is obtained from the Debian buster repository.\r\n\r\nmaybe you can upgrade to a more recent version?\r\n>> We will most likely do this. But it we are interested to know what caused the crash. This will help us to be doubly sure that the latest version fixes it. Also because this issue was seen only once, we may not be in a position to confirm if the upgraded version fixes the crash.\r\n\r\n> @rajendra-dendukuri thanks. anything else you can tell us about what's leading to this crash? anything special about the system on which it runs? the redis binary the one supplied by the OS? maybe you can upgrade to a more recent version?\r\n\r\n"
