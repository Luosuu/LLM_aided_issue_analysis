  "title": "[BUG] Some passwords cannot be entered in `redis-cli`",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nThis password:\r\n\r\n```\r\n^8T>6Na{u|jp>+v\"55\\@_;OU(OR]7mbAYGqsfyu48(j'%hQH7;v*f1H${*gD(Se'\r\n```\r\n\r\ncannot be entered in `redis-cli`.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nLoad this ACL from file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuser some_admin_user on allcommands >^8T>6Na{u|jp>+v\"55\\@_;OU(OR]7mbAYGqsfyu48(j'%hQH7;v*f1H${*gD(Se'\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen start `redis-cli` and try to issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nauth some_admin_user ^8T>6Na{u|jp>+v\"55\\@_;OU(OR]7mbAYGqsfyu48(j'%hQH7;v*f1H${*gD(Se'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt won't work, it will say `Invalid argument(s)`. Which means incorrect password, somehow.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI would expect the password to be accepted.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nThis is probably an escaping issue of some kind, if redis is truly binary safe. Either the database is parsing syntax inside the password while reading from the file, or `redis-cli` is parsing syntax inside the password when trying to issue the `AUTH` command. I tried quoting and backslash escaping special characters but I couldn't find any combination that worked. It would be nice to know what is going on and if it can be fixed.\r\n\r\nI was able to resolve the issue by generating a different password that did not include quotation marks or backslashes.",

      "body": "The problem here is related to character escaping in the cli, not redis itself. Since your password contains a `\"`, the cli is trying to parse a quoted string. The correct way to send the command requires you to escape the argument, like: `auth user \">^8T>6Na{u|jp>+v\\\"55\\@_;OU(OR]7mbAYGqsfyu48(j'%hQH7;v*f1H${*gD(Se'\"`."
