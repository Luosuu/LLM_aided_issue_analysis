  "title": "[BUG]libc dependency while uplifting redis library from 6.2.12 to 6.2.13",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nI am using Oracle Linux 7, which is similar to redhat 7. In this, the default supported libc version is libc-2.17.so. With the above setup, when we install Redis 6.2.12 version, everything seems to be working properly. Recently, I have uplifted to Redis 6.2.13 and there is a direct dependency on libc library. It specifically requires libc-2.28.so instead of libc-2.17.so. However, in the previous version of Redis i.e 6.2.12, the libc used was libc-2.17.so.\r\n\r\nNOTE : From what I understand, libc-2.28.so is generally available from linux 8 onwards. So, can someone please let me know if the dependency on libc-2.28.so is added intentionally for Redis 6.2.13? If not, how this dependency can be resolved ?\r\nA short description of the bug.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior and/or a minimal code sample.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nA description of what you expected to happen.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nAny additional information that is relevant to the problem.\r\n",
