  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nfrom the [docs](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/xread/) \r\n\r\nthere is this command that reads last item from all streams\r\n```redis\r\n> XREAD STREAM streamA streamB streamC streamD + + + +\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut using \"STREAM\" results in `\"ERR syntax error\"`. Maybe it was a typo, but using \r\n\r\n```redis\r\n> XREAD STREAMS streamA streamB streamC streamD + + + +\r\n```\r\n\r\nleads to `\"ERR Invalid stream ID specified as stream command argument\"` error.\r\n\r\nI have not successfully used the XREAD with + operator as mentioned in the docs yet\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\ncall\r\n```redis\r\n> XADD streamA * test test\r\n> XREAD STREAMS streamA +\r\n```\r\nresults in `\"ERR Invalid stream ID specified as stream command argument\"`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nexpects to return last item in stream\r\n",
