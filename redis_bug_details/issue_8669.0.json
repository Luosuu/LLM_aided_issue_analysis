  "title": "[BUG] Redis installed from the Redis Labs PPA fails to daemonize on WSL2",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nPreviously, [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) users could install redis from our PPA and start the server. We (Redis Labs) created a video showing how to do this.\r\n\r\nNow, though, redis installed from our PPA doesn't start correctly. This is what users see -- the process hangs:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97182/111716347-0edc3200-8813-11eb-8d3b-91f79b1ebbf2.png)\r\n\r\nThis stays in the foreground until you end it with control-C.\r\n\r\nThe process _has_ started:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot      6803  0.0  0.0  63972  4068 pts/9    S+   18:05   0:00          |   \\_ sudo service redis-server start\r\nroot      6808  0.0  0.0   4632  1780 pts/9    S+   18:05   0:00          |       \\_ /bin/sh /etc/init.d/redis-server start\r\nredis     6829  0.4  0.0  82884 13392 pts/9    Sl+  18:05   0:00          |           \\_ /usr/bin/redis-server 127.0.0.1:6379\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you can connect from another shell... but `sudo service redis-server start` never exits.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n- Use latest public Windows 10\r\n- Install WSL2\r\n- Install Ubuntu 18.04 (this also happens on 20)\r\n- Add our PPA: `sudo service redis-server start`\r\n- Update and install redis: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install redis`\r\n- Try to start redis: `sudo service redis-server start`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nRunning `sudo service redis-server start` should start redis and exit.\r\n",
