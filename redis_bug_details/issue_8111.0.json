  "title": "[BUG] Redis doesn't check a return code of fsync thus potentially corrupting keys/values and silently returning them.",
  "body": "According to researchers Anthony Rebello, Yuvraj Patel, Ramnatthan Alagappan, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, and Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau of University of Wisconsin - Madison, Redis doesn't check a return code of fsync system call.\r\n\r\nThey state that under certain conditions it may lead to corrupted keys or values being obliviously returned.\r\n\r\nLink to the paper: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc20-rebello.pdf",

      "body": "Yeah, when fsync fails it usually means you have no idea what has happened underneath on the system. For RDBs, we should be aborting the snapshot and trying again. I'm less sure what we should do about AOFs though, that seems to be the place we are generally ignoring the fsync calls. "

      "body": "I agree that we shouldn't crash. In Postgres the authoritative state is on disk, so an fsync means you don't know what happened so you should reload the log. In redis, the state is in memory, so we should be able to continue. I don't know much about aof, we could also consider starting a new file."
