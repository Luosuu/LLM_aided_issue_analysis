  "title": "a bug in SORT/STORE comand output",
  "body": "with the SORT param, the SORT command _usually_ output an integer, indicating the number of items in the stored set, but when output is null, for example, the key to be sorted does not exist (or is empty), the output of SORT with STORE is empty set, not a number anymore!  I think it shall be consistent, i.e. without STORE, bulk output (or empty), with STORE, integer output (including 0).\n",

      "body": "Verified, definitely a bug. There is an additional one I discovered just now looking at the code:\n\n```\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> flushall\nOK\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> lpush foo bar\n(integer) 1\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> sort foo limit 10 10 store zap\n(integer) 0\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> keys *\n1) \"zap\"\n2) \"foo\"\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> llen za\n(integer) 0\n```\n\nA key with an empty list was just created, that is not coherent with the Redis behavior of deleting keys without elements.\n\nFixing both, thanks for reporting.\n"
