  "title": "[BUG] \"auth default foo\" returns OK even if there is no password set for \"default\"",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nI launched a Redis Docker instance of Redis `7.0.5`. I did not set password for the `default` user.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nroot@a3f4913c94dd:/data# redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379\r\nlocalhost:6379> scan 0\r\n1) \"0\"\r\n2) (empty array)\r\nlocalhost:6379> set hello world ex 10\r\nOK\r\nlocalhost:6379> get hello\r\n\"world\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the `auth default foo` command works as follows.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nroot@a3f4913c94dd:/data# redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379\r\nlocalhost:6379> auth default foo\r\nOK\r\nlocalhost:6379> set hello world ex 10\r\nOK\r\nlocalhost:6379> get hello\r\n\"world\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Docker run\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  ~ $ docker run --name tredis --rm -dit redis:7.0.5\r\n  9563cebae4b40b67b62c974dc7b9bdab4b639f2baf7945b7deb1d6dd34153a70\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n2. Get into the container.\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  ~ $ docker exec -it tredis bash\r\n  root@9563cebae4b4:/data#\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n3. Issue the `auth` command.\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  root@9563cebae4b4:/data# redis-cli\r\n  127.0.0.1:6379> auth default foo\r\n  OK\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nAs the `default` username does not require password, `auth default foo` should error.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> info server\r\n# Server\r\nredis_version:7.0.5\r\nredis_git_sha1:00000000\r\nredis_git_dirty:0\r\nredis_build_id:2e713f81c77ffebe\r\nredis_mode:standalone\r\nos:Linux 6.6.12-linuxkit aarch64\r\narch_bits:64\r\nmonotonic_clock:POSIX clock_gettime\r\nmultiplexing_api:epoll\r\natomicvar_api:c11-builtin\r\ngcc_version:10.2.1\r\nprocess_id:1\r\nprocess_supervised:no\r\nrun_id:767e986479167818d2cd7313a9e39fdf31772730\r\ntcp_port:6379\r\nserver_time_usec:1728541379594873\r\nuptime_in_seconds:196\r\nuptime_in_days:0\r\nhz:10\r\nconfigured_hz:10\r\nlru_clock:488131\r\nexecutable:/data/redis-server\r\nconfig_file:\r\nio_threads_active:0\r\n```\r\n",

The application returns OK and puts me under the illusion that the connection to Redis is protected.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I am curious on the ACL part of Redis. We can create a username and password via ACL after connected to Redis without auth. But the username and password won't enforce auth for future connections. Does that mean Redis auth is enforced by listening ports at startup?"
