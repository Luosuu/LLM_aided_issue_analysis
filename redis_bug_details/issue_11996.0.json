  "title": "[BUG] Command propagation issue",
  "body": "In the process of command propagation, one command is lost, while other commands are not lost. In this command propagation process, the slave node does not send ack to confirm offset. When sending ack, the offset does not correspond to that of the master node. The master node cannot recover data with the offset of the slave node. Will the master node re-generate rdb files via bgsave and then load the slave node\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that this issue tracker should be used for reporting bugs or proposing improvements to the Redis server.\r\n\r\nGenerally, questions about using Redis should be directed to the [community](https://redis.io/community):\r\n\r\n* [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/redis-db)\r\n* [the `redis` tag at StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/redis)\r\n* [/r/redis subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/redis)\r\n* [github discussions](https://github.com/redis/redis/discussions)\r\n\r\nIt is also possible that your question was already asked here, so please do a quick issues search before submitting.
