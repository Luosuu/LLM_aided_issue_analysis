  "title": "[BUG] lpop/pop with count 0 returning null",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nThe [LPOP documentation](https://redis.io/commands/lpop) says that when a count is given the result is \"Array reply: list of popped elements, or nil when key does not exist.\" However, [this fast path](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/c5e6a6204c4cf57f85e7c83a9b4e99f1a7204fd2/src/t_list.c#L538) writes a nil reply when count is 0, rather than an empty list.\r\n\r\nIt's also exiting before even checking the type of the key, so instead of getting a WRONGTYPE error, it can \"successfully\" do an LPOP on non-lists. This differs from `SPOP key 0` which return a WRONGTYPE error.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nWith `redis-cli` (note, I'm using server version 6.2.6, but only have redis-cli 5.0.7 handy, so this is presumably all RESP2):\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> rpush foo a\r\n(integer) 1\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> lpop foo 0\r\n(nil)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nExpected to get `(empty list or set)`.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nIt seems a bit odd that SPOP returns an empty array if the key does not exist while LPOP/RPOP returns nil.",
