  "title": "test suite: offset port number for every worker to avoid EADDRINUSE",
  "body": "The `aof-race` integration test fails once in a while with `redis-server` that can't start because the port is already in use. This can be fixed by giving every test worker a different port offset (probably with some room to spare -- e.g. difference of 10 between workers -- because some tests spawn multiple Redis processes).\n",
