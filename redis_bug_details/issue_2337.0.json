  "title": "redis-benchmark does not report error when no auth is provided ",
  "body": "Running `redis-benchmark` does not report error when test is running without the `-a` flag for a server which requires authentication. \n\nThe results reported are effectively for time to get a `(error) NOAUTH Authentication required.` response rather than actually run the command. So, the benchmark reports incorrect results.\n\nThe fix could be to run a test `ping` to test whether authentication is required or not.\n",
