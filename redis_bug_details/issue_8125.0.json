Opted to omit from example.\r\n\r\n> is there any other traffic on redis? what's the `hz` config setting?\r\n\r\nIn my actual case there is quite a bit of traffic, data is added at a much higher rate to a number of streams. This is where I first noticed. But I have tested this small scale (1 stream, 1 insertion/second) with the same result. There are no other clients connected to redis.\r\n\r\n`hz` is the default 10. I have tried setting it higher but it doesn't seem to help."
