  "title": "[BUG] Should `SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE` be rejected in `MULTI`?",
  "body": "Hi @MeirShpilraien, @oranagra,\r\n\r\nI noticed that `SUBSCRIBE` inside `MULTI` is allowed for maintaining backward compatibility (https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/8025). However, it seems to produce responses that a client can't handle, for example, saying that a client issues the following commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMULTI\r\nSUBSCRIBE c1 c2 c3\r\nSET k v\r\nGET k\r\nEXEC\r\n```\r\nThen Redis will respond with:\r\n```\r\n+ OK\r\n+ QUEUED\r\n+ QUEUED\r\n+ QUEUED\r\n*\r\n  > subscribe c1\r\n  > subscribe c2\r\n  > subscribe c3\r\n+ OK                // leaked response for SET k v\r\n$ v                 // leaked response for GET k\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs doing `SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE` inside `MULTI` really a valid use case? \r\n",
