  "title": "[BUG] redis-benchmark non clustered benchmark forces always the same hash tag {tag} which makes proxy setups to be limited by standalone performance",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nGiven that on redis-benchmark we only replace the tag placeholder \":{tag}\" when the `--cluster` flag is passed, on setups that rely on a proxy to abstract the cluster topology to the client this makes them to be limited by standalone performance ( given that we're always targeting the same hash slot )\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nRun for example a benchmark with a keyspace length larger that 1 and notice that we will always target the shard with the slot of {tag}. Example of Redis Enterprise with single endpoint setup and running the following benchmark:\r\n```\r\nredis-benchmark -r 16000 -h <HOST>  -p 12000  -t GET -n 100000000 -d 1024 -P 50 -c 50 \r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5832149/96522813-287d4b80-126c-11eb-83c2-fed5172e9118.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nWe should only include the hash tag when the `--cluster` flag is passed to prevent an easy fix this. \r\n",
