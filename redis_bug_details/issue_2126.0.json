Is there anything unusual about your machine (very small memory, very slow, shared, overloaded, etc)?  Some of the tests are based on timing, so if the machine can't deliver results in time then tests can't complete properly.  (you can manually edit some of the tests to increase the timeout waiting)\n\nThere's a similar issue at https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/944 too.\n"

The Redis tests are very thorough and heavy duty.  But—just because the Redis test suite fails, it doesn't mean Redis isn't working on your platform.\n\nYou can also review any logs left over in the `tests/tmp/*` directories.  You may have to edit the test code to _not_ clean up after tests though (see: `tests/instances.tcl:cleanup()`; if the test suite completes, it'll delete all logs, but you can delete the `rm -rf` to keep logs around).\n"
