  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nAOF compaction stopped suddenly, crashing our server because we've run out of disk space.\r\n\r\nI have not steps to reproduce this, unfortunately. It just happened for the second time\r\n\r\nI expect that this doesn't suddenly happen, because it crashses the database\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nWe are using v6.2.6\r\n\r\nNormal behaviour, you can see the disk usage growing a bit, but is compacted in every spike\r\n![image (10)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6980777/171374252-3972064c-ded7-4c47-ac28-203c5d0b3811.png)\r\n6\r\n\r\nBehavior after AOF compaction stopped working:\r\n![image (12)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6980777/171377371-046ffb6d-8aba-467e-94a8-dab4a8962e70.png)\r\n\r\nIs this a known issue?
