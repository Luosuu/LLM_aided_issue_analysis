  "title": "[BUG] Slot migrated among cluster nodes.",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWe have 3 node cluster and during initial setup slots was properly distributed among cluster nodes,we observed that cluster nodes rebooted several times over the period of time and suspect this causes slot migration between nodes.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nWe suspect nodes rebooted and causes connection failure that might have triggered slot migration\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nRedis slots should be static and bind to the respective node only.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nCluster configuration are as follows,\r\n```\r\ncluster-enabled yes\r\ncluster-config-file node_6379.conf\r\ncluster-node-timeout 5000\r\ncluster-require-full-coverage yes\r\n```\r\n\r\nFollowing are the redis logs from nodes,\r\n\r\n```\r\n22414:M 15 Oct 2022 01:21:30.385 # I have keys for slot 16377, but the slot is assigned to another node.
