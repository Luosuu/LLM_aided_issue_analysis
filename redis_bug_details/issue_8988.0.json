  "title": "[BUG] Redis benchmark can't run when config `save` not set",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nRedis benchmark can't run when config `save` not set, and throw `ERROR: failed to fetch CONFIG from ***host***`.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it doesn't make sense that benchmark can't work without that config.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there are some cloud providers providing redis servers but using own backup tech and forcing config `save` empty, and at these situations, benchmark can't run on these servers forever.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Start a redis server using config file with no config `save` ;\r\n2. Run benchmark on it.\r\n![Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9762652/119453275-d3f1ff80-bd69-11eb-8733-449f4f6ee029.png)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nRun as normal.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nForgive my poor English. **And redis benchmark *5.5* works properly but *6.2* has this problem**.\r\n",

And yes, it can run. But there is a warning with same message, IDK if it's designed to show that message.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9762652/119508851-affee000-bda2-11eb-9bf4-f45747e753df.png)\r\n"
