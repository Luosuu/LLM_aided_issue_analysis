Creating an SSL structure for the first time increments the reference count. Freeing it (using SSL_free) decrements it. When the reference count drops to zero, any memory or resources allocated to theSSLstructure are freed.\"\r\n\r\n![1662197505418](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57169201/188264800-5bff1221-3943-4b67-ae70-78dbaee6124e.png)\r\n\r\n",
