I'm not sure what can cause this issue.\r\n",

I've logged into docker container as `redis` user and tried to create files in conf dir, in /tmp dir and in data dir and it all went fine. This problem was't appearing until 5.0.10; \r\n\r\nIm using this setup for ~6months, and as I've mentioned I was using `5-buster` tag so it deploys `latest` version of this branch on occasional re-deployment. Once it upgraded to 5.0.10 problems appeared.\r\n\r\nData directory on a host machine has the following perms: \r\n\r\n```\r\nnomad_host_volumes:\r\n  - name: redis\r\n    path: /opt/redis\r\n    read_only: false\r\n    owner: 999\r\n    group: 999\r\n    mode: \"0700\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce I start using 6.0.10 problem simply disappeared. So it doesn't look like data directory permissions issue.\r\n"

If you do see the file get created, can you provide info on file permissions and ownership?\r\n\r\nTheoretically if the file gets created with some restricted permissions (e.g. due to `umask` settings), Redis would not be able to re-create it. I think it would be very unlikely because the name should be unique (using system time) but not totally impossible."
