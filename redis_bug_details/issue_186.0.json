  "title": "Add a test to verify that Redis actively expires data.",
  "body": "This is as simple as populating the DB with random keys with expires and then using DBSIZE to see the key eviction working.\nThis test is needed as I fixed a bug after the introduction of millisecond precision expires that was not picked promptly because of the lack of such a test. Too late here to add it now so filing a bug for myself.\n",
