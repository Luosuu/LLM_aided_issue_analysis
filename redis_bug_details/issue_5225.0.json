  "body": "in file server.c\r\n```c\r\n    dirty = server.dirty;\r\n    start = ustime();\r\n    c->cmd->proc(c);\r\n    duration = ustime()-start;\r\n```\r\nwhere ustime defined as\r\n```c\r\n/* Return the UNIX time in microseconds */\r\nlong long ustime(void) {\r\n    struct timeval tv;\r\n    long long ust;\r\n\r\n    gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);\r\n    ust = ((long long)tv.tv_sec)*1000000;\r\n    ust += tv.tv_usec;\r\n    return ust;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`gettimeofday` will be influence by setting of wall clock, such as system admin or NTP. Maybe it is better to use `MONOTONIC` time to measure time cost of function(such as `clock_gettime`)?\r\n\r\n* ref https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/5217\r\n* ref https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/4851",
