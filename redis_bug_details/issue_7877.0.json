  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nBlocking reads on Redis Cluster replica nodes (in readonly mode) always get redirected to a master node.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nConnect to a replica node, go into a readonly mode, do a blocking read, e.g.:\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1:6381> CONNECT 127.0.0.1 6385\r\n127.0.0.1:6385> READONLY\r\nOK\r\n127.0.0.1:6385> XREAD STREAMS k 0\r\n(nil)\r\n127.0.0.1:6385> XREAD BLOCK 100 STREAMS k 0\r\n-> Redirected to slot [7629] located at 127.0.0.1:6381\r\n(nil)\r\n127.0.0.1:6381> \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nAccording to documentation of [`READONLY`](https://redis.io/commands/readonly):\r\n> When the connection is in readonly mode, the cluster will send a redirection to the client only if the operation involves keys not served by the replica's master node.\r\n\r\nblocking reads should not get redirected to a master node.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nIIUC the `clusterRedirectBlockedClientIfNeeded` does not handle the case when the blocking read is on a replica node:\r\nhttps://github.com/redis/redis/blob/3945a321779a0be52e556aa11babb3fe15883a78/src/cluster.c#L5856-L5862",
