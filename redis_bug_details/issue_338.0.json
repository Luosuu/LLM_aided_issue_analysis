  "body": "I'm getting a problem when trying to install redis with homebrew. I'm using OS X 10.7.3 and XCode 4.3 (gcc 4.2.1). The error occurs when compiling hiredis (bundled in deps). The output is here: https://gist.github.com/1852852\n\nThis is the same problem described here: https://github.com/antirez/hiredis/issues/53\n\nI've fix referenced in the above hiredis issue (https://github.com/antirez/hiredis/compare/5def8643...2da784ce) does fix the issue, but is not included in the hiredis that's bundled in deps. Updating the bundled hiredis version should resolve this.\n",
