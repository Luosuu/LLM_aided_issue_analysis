How could it be fixed or avoid this situation in the future?\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior and/or a minimal code sample.\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nA description of what you expected to happen.\r\n\r\nI would expect to still have just one master.",

I suggest for a start seeking assistance from the [spotahome/redis-operator](https://github.com/spotahome/redis-operator) to determine whether others are also experiencing this issue, and if it's specific to certain versions or exist from day one. If, with the help of other contributors, you're able to confidently identify this as a core Redis issue and have clear steps to reproduce it, please inform us. \r\n\r\nBTW, I peeped to the logs and saw some write error to configuration file. Check it. Didn't look further.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMoti"
