      "body": "@Hyxl1017 this is a very old version, there's no reason to look into it if the bug no longer exist in the latest (`unstable` branch).\r\ni.e. if they're already fixed, we won't \"re-fix\" them, right? and won't re-release 2.8.4 (or any new 2.8.x version since it's so old).\r\nfurther more, if these bugs are in hiredis, specifically if they exist in the latest (`master` branch), they should be reported and fixed there (https://github.com/redis/hiredis)"
