  "title": "[BUG] No error when systemd configured but not compiled",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nIf you setup Redis with systemd but you use a binary that was not compiled with systemd support, there is no clear error in the log. Info command does not show if the systemd support was compiled or not. I would prefer that Redis would log an error that the systemd support must be compiled if you use `supervised systemd`.\r\n\r\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/1031891/redis-service-hangs-with-systemctl-and-type-notify\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nCompile Redis without systemd support.\r\n\r\nredis.service\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Service]\r\nType=notify\r\nExecStart=/opt/redis/bin/redis-server /opt/redis/conf/redis-master.conf\r\nTimeoutStartSec=60\r\nTimeoutStopSec=60\r\nRestartSec=5s\r\nRestart=on-success\r\n```\r\n\r\nredis-master.conf\r\n\r\n```\r\ndaemonize no\r\nsupervised systemd\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run this service, the Redis process starts but the `systemctl` hangs and I have to press Ctrl-C to get back to shell. This is in the logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n69486:C 28 Aug 2020 17:31:14.545 # Redis version=6.0.6, bits=64, commit=00000000, modified=0, pid=69486, just started\r\n69486:C 28 Aug 2020 17:31:14.545 # Configuration loaded\r\n69486:C 28 Aug 2020 17:31:14.545 # WARNING supervised by systemd - you MUST set appropriate values for TimeoutStartSec and TimeoutStopSec in your service unit.\r\n69486:M 28 Aug 2020 17:31:14.546 * Increased maximum number of open files to 4096 (it was originally set to 1024).\r\n69486:M 28 Aug 2020 17:31:14.547 * Running mode=standalone, port=6380.\r\n69486:M 28 Aug 2020 17:31:14.547 # Server initialized\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nRedis shall log that  `supervised systemd` requires libsystemd support to be compiled in. \r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nAny additional information that is relevant to the problem.\r\n",
