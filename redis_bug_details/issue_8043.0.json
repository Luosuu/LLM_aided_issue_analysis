      "body": "@galleChristian your text is really hard to follow.\r\nplease try to clean it up (both formatting issues, and also maybe you can add more context or make it easier to follow).\r\n\r\nif i understand correctly, you're complaining about two things:\r\n1. the these two arrays of 64 elements are too big (we won't actually reach the high indexes. what number do you suggest? p.s. few more bytes on the stack won't cause any damage..\r\n2. the type of the `rank` array needs to be `unsigned long` rather than `unsigned int`. since it would overflow if the skiplist has more than 2G elements.\r\n\r\nis that right?\r\ndo you wanna open a pull request?"
