  "title": "[BUG] Potential buffer overrun in serverLog",
  "body": "In the file `src/server.c`, the function `serverLogRaw` has the following [code](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/9e1b879f5bcbf105d5581c77f8c368b0ef1708f6/src/server.c#L103):\r\n```\r\nvoid serverLogRaw(int level, const char *msg) {\r\n    const int syslogLevelMap[] = { LOG_DEBUG, LOG_INFO, LOG_NOTICE, LOG_WARNING };\r\n    \r\n    ....\r\n    level &= 0xff; /* clear flags */\r\n    if (level < server.verbosity) return;\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    if (server.syslog_enabled) syslog(syslogLevelMap[level], \"%s\", msg);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen `level` is given a large value, the buffer `syslogLevelMap` is overflowed. Given that `severLog` is called extensively in the codebase, I think a proper check is needed.\r\n",

Though I would suggest adding an assertion here.  "
