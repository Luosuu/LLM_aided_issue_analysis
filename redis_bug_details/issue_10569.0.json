  "title": "[BUG] Stream consumer group lag heuristic isn't handled when executing `XCLAIM ... LASTID`",
  "body": "This is a potential issue due to an omission in the design.\r\n\r\nIt was raised during a CR w/ @guybe7.\r\n\r\nQuick context: the lag heuristic depends on the stream's and the cg's counters (entries_added & entries_read). Change's to the group's last_id should, in theory, invalidate its entries_read to keep correctness.\r\n\r\nA problem may arise when issuing the `XCLAIM` with the `LASTID` argument. This invocation is there, by the looks of it, for replication purposes and is used internally only (I do hope). For correctness, the CG's entries_read needs to be invalidation around this [LoC](https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/c81c7f51c38de6dff5ffc55b5184061b84c7ea5f#diff-9f89868d206f9dbc0e415ba1f4f00b88f3c8766fafe346aa0744ae64024e052bL2964)",
