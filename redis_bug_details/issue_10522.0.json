  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nIt's entirely possible I'm just doing something stupid here, but I believe this may also be a bug. \r\n\r\nI was looking to use specific, pre-determined IDs in a stream, and was interested in using the Redis feature to automatically generate the sequence part, as documented here: https://redis.io/commands/xadd/\r\n\r\nHowever, I've been unable to make it work on my own - and even following the example as written in the documentation, it doesn't seem to work, instead giving you an error:  \"ERR Invalid stream ID specified as stream command argument\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nTry and run the example in the documentation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nXADD mystream 1526919030474-55 message \"Hello,\"\r\n\"1526919030474-55\"\r\nXADD mystream 1526919030474-* message \" World!\"\r\nERR Invalid stream ID specified as stream command argument\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe example to work\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nRedis 6.2.6.\r\n",
