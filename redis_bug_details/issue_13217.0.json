  "title": "[CRASH] Redis Instance is down while master sync",
  "body": "\r\n**Description of the Problem**\r\n- We have total of 72 redis cluster instances (36 master & 36 slave) and each instance contains approximately 68 millions (29 GB) data. \r\n- In order to check whether the redis instance is up properly from the dump file, we kill the redis process on one of the slave instances and then start it again. However, redis instance is down during the **\"MASTER <-> REPLICA sync: Flushing old data\"** step. When we remove the dump file and start the redis instance again, we do not encounter such problem. Dump file's size is 13 GB\r\n- We tried to increase the client-output-buffer-limit on this slave node and also its master (both tried the configs 1GB/256MB & 3GB/1GB) but it did not work.\r\n`CONFIG set client-output-buffer-limit \"normal 0 0 0 slave 1073741824 268435456 60 pubsub 33554432 8388608 60\"`\r\n\r\nDo you have any solutions for this problem?\r\n\r\n**Crash Report**\r\nWe hid the redis host and port information in the below log since it is a corporate information. \r\n\r\n25084:C 17 Apr 2024 01:30:24.038 # oO0OoO0OoO0Oo Redis is starting oO0OoO0OoO0Oo\r\n25084:C 17 Apr 2024 01:30:24.039 # Redis version=6.0.5, bits=64, commit=00000000, modified=0, pid=25084, just started\r\n25084:C 17 Apr 2024 01:30:24.040 # Configuration loaded\r\n25084:M 17 Apr 2024 01:30:24.041 * Increased maximum number of open files to 10032 (it was originally set to 1024).\r\n25084:M 17 Apr 2024 01:30:24.043 * Node configuration loaded, I'm 39170ea79f2889e3012e860fbad701fb70f80364\r\n25084:M 17 Apr 2024 01:30:24.045 * Running mode=cluster, port=XXX.\r\n25084:M 17 Apr 2024 01:30:24.046 # Server initialized\r\n25084:M 17 Apr 2024 01:30:24.047 # WARNING you have Transparent Huge Pages (THP) support enabled in your kernel.
