  "title": "[BUG] Crash of Redis Server - have to  #ReadOnlyDirectories=/",
  "body": "On a Raspi 4 Debian 11 my redis server (version=6.0.16) suddenly crashes after a while.\r\n\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\nreboot and wait\r\n\r\nAfter a reboot everything works, but then I get an odd error from redis server which breaks after a while:\r\n\r\njournalctl -f -u redis-server\r\n> -- Journal begins at Thu 2024-10-24 13:07:28 CEST. --\r\nOkt 24 14:03:12 GLOIN systemd[1]: Stopped Advanced key-value store.\r\nOkt 24 14:03:12 GLOIN systemd[1]: Starting Advanced key-value store...\r\nOkt 24 14:03:22 GLOIN systemd[314571]: redis-server.service: Failed to set up mount namespacing: /run/systemd/unit-root/: Host is down\r\nOkt 24 14:03:22 GLOIN systemd[314571]: redis-server.service: Failed at step NAMESPACE spawning /usr/bin/redis-server: Host is down\r\nOkt 24 14:03:22 GLOIN systemd[1]: redis-server.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=226/NAMESPACE\r\nOkt 24 14:03:22 GLOIN systemd[1]: redis-server.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.\r\nOkt 24 14:03:22 GLOIN systemd[1]: Failed to start Advanced key-value store.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I comment out\r\nReadOnlyDirectories=/\r\nin the redis systemd service file it would work. But I donâ€™t like to do that.\r\n\r\nThe server ran for years with this configuration without problem and I have no idea what changed to provoke this behaviour.\r\nAlso the solution, which I found on the internet seems odd.\r\nIs it ok to comment ReadOnlyDirectories out? \r\nOr what else could I do to fix that?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",

I am also not sure, that's why I'm here. I have no clue about redis and it's requirements. I read on the internet that disableing `ReadOnlyDirectories=/ in the service file solves the problem. That's why I did it and it works. I am here to find out about \r\n+ the side effects of that, \r\n+ why it solves the problem,\r\n+ and what the actual reason is for redis to crash\r\n\r\nI thought you might know anything about this.\r\nIf you tell me where to find additional data which you need I can provide it."
