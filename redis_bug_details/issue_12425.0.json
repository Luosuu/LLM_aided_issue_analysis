  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen calling MONITOR when already in monitor mode (MONITOR called a second time), the command gets no reply.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ telnet 127.0.0.1 6379\r\nTrying 127.0.0.1...\r\nConnected to 127.0.0.1.\r\nEscape character is '^]'.\r\nmonitor\r\n+OK\r\nmonitor\r\nmonitor\r\nmonitor\r\nping\r\n+PONG\r\n+1689844887.413603 [0 127.0.0.1:57780] \"ping\"\r\nquit\r\n+OK\r\nConnection closed by foreign host.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe second `monitor` call should return `+OK` just like the first one.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, return an error like `-ERR Already monitoring`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, just document this behaviour.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nWhy do I care at all? When writing an asynchronous client library, it's important to not get out of sync when matching incoming replies to the corresponding commands. I discovered this while implementing RESET in hiredis async API.",
