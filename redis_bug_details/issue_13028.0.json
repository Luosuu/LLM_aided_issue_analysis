  "title": "[BUG] json.get default behavior is dumb and unintuitive",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen I JSON.GET a single field from a JSON object, the response is an array with a single value in it. This is unintuitive and dumb (IMO). You're making 1000s of developers make functions to handle your array case when only a single value is requested. I'm sure you won't fix it, as it seems to be \"by design\" but holy crap it's a bad f'n design.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nWhen I JSON.GET a single field, I should get the value of that field, not an array of field values with only one entry.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nWhen I JSON.GET `$` on a key, I get the value stored. That makes no sense based on this logic. How dumb.\r\n",
