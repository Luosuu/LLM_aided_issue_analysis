  "title": "[BUG] WATCH ignores keys which has expired",
  "body": "Currently, WATCH in a multi-exec transaction will ignore expired keys. So if a key that was previously being watched is expired and deleted from Redis, WATCH will not consider it at all... There is a TCL test for this behavior \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/tests/unit/multi.tcl#L224\r\n\r\nHowever, this behavior doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me. If I am watching an item and the item gets deleted from Redis, I would want to be notified... Anyone know the reason behind this behavior in Redis? ",

Looks like a bug, I'm surprised no one complained about it for so many years. People must not be using watch that much...\" Got a thumbs up"
