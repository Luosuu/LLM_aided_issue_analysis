Thanks very much.",

If you mention line numbers, you should probably mention a branch name or a git sha. \r\n\r\nRedis doesn't use `malloc` directly. It uses `zmalloc`, and that one never returns NULL. Instead, it panics and exists when an allocation fails. So the few places that do check for NULL in Redis are for the most part dead code. (the reception are the recently introduced `ztrymalloc` calls. \r\n\r\nI didn't go over all the issues you opened, please close the ones that are not applicable to redis, and maybe open in the repo where that code you tested actually exists. \r\nIf there's anything that is applicable for redis, feel free to mention me there, but note that as is clear from my text above, redis doesn't aim to cope with a failed allocation in most places.
