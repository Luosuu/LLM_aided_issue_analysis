  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nLPOP with count argument returns Null bulk reply instead of array null reply. As per [documentation](https://redis.io/commands/lpop) \r\n\r\n    When called with the count argument:\r\n\r\n    Array reply: list of popped elements, or nil when key does not exist.\r\n\r\nWhen running against Redis 6.2.6, we get\r\n\r\n    LPOP NONEXISTINGLIST 10\r\n    $-1\r\n\r\ninstead of\r\n\r\n    \"*-1\\r\\n\"\r\n\r\nwhich is a null array, as documented.\r\n\r\nDoes the LPOP key [count] always return Bulk Null reply when no list exists to pop from regardless of count is provided or not?\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nRun the command against Redis 6.2.6\r\n\r\nLPOP NONEXISTINGLIST 10\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n>  \"*-1\\r\\n\"\r\n\r\n**Additional Information**\r\n[Issue](https://github.com/redis/redis-doc/issues/1734) was first raised in Redis doc.\r\n",
