  "title": "[BUG] Wait command is not working properly on blocking commands",
  "body": "Redis updates the replication offset on `commandProcessed` function which are called right after the `processCommand` finished, assuming that this indicate that the command was also finished. In case of module that takes the execution to a background thread and blocks the client, this assumption is not true. This cause the master to think that the command execution was finished and the `wait` command to **not** wait until the command invocation was actually done.\r\n\r\nNotice that this issue can only happened with modules, Redis will **never** block the master connection.\r\n\r\n2 possible solutions:\r\n1. State that modules should also **never** block the master connection.\r\n2. Fix the replication data to be updated when the client is unblocked (in case the command blocked the client).",

      "body": "the problem is that the replication offset is linear, so in two consecutive commands that arrived, if the first one gets blocked, and the second one finished, we can't REPLCONF ACK the second without the first.\r\ni suppose we have no other resort than forbid blocking commands from the mater link."
