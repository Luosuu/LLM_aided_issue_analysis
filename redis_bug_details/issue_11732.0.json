      "body": "> ... should a negative timeout block?\r\n\r\nThe very idea of a negative timeout is weird, and there's no intuitive way to interpret it imo. If I rewrite Redis from scratch, valid blocking timeout values would be either 0 or a positive integer as number of msecs. Ideally, negative values should raise an -ERR. Less ideally, negatives should be silently treated as non-blocking. "
