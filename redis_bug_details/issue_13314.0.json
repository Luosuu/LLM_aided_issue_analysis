  "title": "[BUG] Record, deleted from stream, stays in PEL",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nIn our implementation, after reading messages from stream (with XREADGROUP), we delete it from the stream(with XDEL). In this case, messages stay in Pending Entities List, which leads to OOM at some point.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nWe use XADD to add messages, XREAD GROUP to read them, XDEL to delete, and XINFO STREAM FULL to check PEL-count.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nMessages, deleted from the stream with XDEL, should probably be deleted from the PEL too, without explicit XACK. Or, if there is a reason for current behavior to be expected, it should be documented to be clear.",

The first impression is that XDEL would delete the message from all of the storages. So it might be helpful to point out that the deleted message stays in PEL waiting for acknowledgment. BTW, I found out that the XCLAIM attempt on such a message also removes it from PEL"

A message is pending, and as such stored inside the PEL, when it was delivered to some consumer, normally as a side effect of calling [XREADGROUP](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/xreadgroup/), or when a consumer took ownership of a message calling [XCLAIM](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/xclaim/).\r\n```\r\n\r\n"
