  "body": "Description of the bug:\r\n---------------------------\r\nAfter I used Cppcheck to perform static analysis of the source code of Redis I discoverd the following error: \r\nCWE 664 : \"va_list ‘_cpy’ used before va_start() was called\" in deps/hiredis/hiredis.c\r\n\r\nI'm not sure yet if it's a false positive or not, but if it's really a bug, it might affect the good functionality of the project.\r\n",
