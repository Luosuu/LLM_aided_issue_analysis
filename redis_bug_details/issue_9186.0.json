  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nUser parsing #8048 the redis URI will always set `config.user` even in the case of `''` empty string.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/redis/redis/blob/74fe15b3602ed7c003b5c53e45e31f7aa6d4a86f/src/redis-cli.c#L423-L432\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nGiven the redis URI following the standard format:\r\n\r\n```\r\nredis://:<password>@<host>:<port>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe user will be parsed as `''` empty string. Failing to `AUTH` as the default user.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe same behavior as the redis URI:\r\n\r\n```\r\nredis://<password>@<host>:<port>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich will correctly `AUTH` as the default user.\r\n",

      "body": "I see that `\"\"` may be a valid user however you could still invoke redis-cli with `--user \"\"`. In Redis client libraries (javascript, python, go etc.) that do URL parsing I've seen that user is parsed as `\"\"` by default and hence is not used in `AUTH`. The URI spec states that `redis://<password>@<host>:<port>` should be treated as user `<password>` and password `\"\"` . The standard URI format for userinfo is `<user>:<password>` see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.2.1."

      "body": "I'm currently using `redis://:<password>@<host>:<post>` and that works with clients that ignore empty usernames. In redis-cli prior to version 6.2 the username isn't parsed so this URI was compatible with the default user. I can connect explicitly with `-a <password> -h <hostname> -p <port>` just thought the URI connect string is more convenient."
