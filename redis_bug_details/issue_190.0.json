  "title": "Relax make clean (unstable branch.)",
  "body": "Currently into unstable after a 'make clean' we also make clean all the deps inside ../deps.\nThis forces too long recompilation when debugging: lua, hiredis, linoise, jemalloc... at this point we depend on many things.\n\nWe should either:\n- turn 'make clean' into an operation that only cleans Redis itself and add 'make distclean' to clean everything.\n- leave 'make clean' as it is, but add a new clean target that just cleans Redis (no idea about the name of such a target at the moment).\n\nIdeas? Thanks.\n",

      "body": "I feel more comfortable with the first solution ('make clean' only cleans Redis itself), since the target name is short and canonical, and thus it is more convenient when developing/iterating on a daily basis. On the other hand, the distclean (longer target name) is specifically used when appropriate.\n"
