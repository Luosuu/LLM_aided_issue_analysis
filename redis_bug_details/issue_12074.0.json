  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nAccording to the documentation, `LOLWUT` command should create a piece of generative computer art. This is unimplemented in version 7.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nIssue `LOLWUT` command with Redis ver 7.x\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nBeauty.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nThere are functions `lolwut5Command()` and `lolwut6Command()` for previous versions. Yet for version 7 code fallbacks to `lolwutUnstableCommand()` which outputs textual version representation only. No ASCII Art. ",

(Maybe even fix the bug for Redis 7.)"
