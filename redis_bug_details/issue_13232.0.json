      "body": "\"around same point of time\" is vague, and doesn't give enough information to know whether the server is doing anything incorrect here. Delays and overtakes are possible at pretty much every point unless you are talking about two messages on the **same connection** being processed out of order, so for close events: it becomes very hard to say which cam first - the GET or the DEL/UNLINK, i.e. what evidence do you have for the \"after\" in the sentence \"after deleted by first thread\"?"

      "body": "\"around the same point\" means first thread deleted the key then after few mill/microseconds second thread check key existence. The evidence for \"after\" based on retrieving remaining time to live for key as NULL after deleted by first thread even key having enough remaining time to live before deleting the key."
