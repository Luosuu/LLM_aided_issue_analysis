  "title": "[BUG] Can't add a v7.2 node into v6.2 cluster",
  "body": "Hello all,\r\n\r\nWe have a Redis v6 cluster with 27 nodes.\r\nWe wanted to gradually upgrade the cluster to Redis v7.\r\n\r\nAfter creating Redis v7 instances, we were unable to join new Redises to our v6 cluster.\r\n\r\nAfter running command `redis-cli —cluster add-node` command the execution of commands gets stucked at `Waiting for cluster to join` and multiple dots start getting printed.\r\n\r\nAll ports and firewalls are ok and cluster bus port is open.\r\nWe could join Redis7s together but we can’t join them to the v6 cluster.\r\n\r\nmy question is that can we upgrade Redis nodes one by one or we have to setup a brand-new v7 cluster?\r\n\r\nthanks",
