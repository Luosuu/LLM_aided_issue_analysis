  "title": "[BUG] BZMPOP blocks on non key arguments",
  "body": "In Redis 7.0 BZMPOP was introduced allowing to block for any of the provided sets to have at least one element.\r\nHowever this command introduced a change in command arguments for which the current generic blocking [code ](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/t_zset.c#L4044) for zset commands is not considering.\r\n\r\nWhen issuing a bzmpop with timeout and count the command also blocks on the timeout/numkeys/max/min which are not keys.\r\nsince the keys might not exist at the time the command is issued it may block on these keys. In case the user will add zset key which matches one of these arguments, it will cause the command to be unblocked and provide the results for this key.\r\nThis can also be a potential security issue, since in case the user blocking on the command is not authorized for this new key, it would still get access to view the data.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\nClient 1:\r\n```\r\nACL SETUSER ranshid on +@all ~my* nopass\r\nauth ranshid nopass\r\nbzmpop 100 1 myzset max count 10 <--- blocks here\r\n```\r\n\r\nClient 2:\r\n```zadd max 1 one 1 two 3 three```\r\n\r\nclient 1 will be unblocked with this output:\r\n```\r\n1) \"max\"\r\n2) 1) 1) \"three\"\r\n      2) \"3\"\r\n   2) 1) \"two\"\r\n      2) \"2\"\r\n   3) 1) \"one\"\r\n      2) \"1\"\r\n(6.81s)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nClient 1 should have been blocked waiting for myzset to be written.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\nIn my opinion for the blocking infrastructure we can use the same way we take keys for ACK using getKeysFromCommandWithSpecs\r\nin order to iterate and decide if to block on any of the keys.\r\n",
