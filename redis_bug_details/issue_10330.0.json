  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nRedis 6 doesn't shut down if its directory doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n```\r\n~ $ cat redis.conf\r\ndir /Users/dcantrell/temp\r\nunixsocket /Users/dcantrell/redis.sock\r\nport 0\r\n~ $ mkdir temp\r\n~ $ redis-server redis.conf\r\n27790:C 22 Feb 2022 16:07:40.574 # oO0OoO0OoO0Oo Redis is starting oO0OoO0OoO0Oo\r\n27790:C 22 Feb 2022 16:07:40.574 # Redis version=6.2.6, bits=64, commit=00000000, modified=0, pid=27790, just started\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point Redis is running just fine. Now in another terminal ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n~ $ rmdir temp\r\n~ $ kill -TERM 27790         # this is the PID redis-server spat out above\r\n~ $\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut back in the original terminal redis-server says:\r\n\r\n```\r\n27790:signal-handler (1645546400) Received SIGTERM scheduling shutdown...\r\n27790:M 22 Feb 2022 16:13:20.793 # User requested shutdown...\r\n27790:M 22 Feb 2022 16:13:20.793 * Saving the final RDB snapshot before exiting.\r\n27790:M 22 Feb 2022 16:13:20.793 # Failed opening the RDB file dump.rdb (in server root dir unknown) for saving: No such file or directory\r\n27790:M 22 Feb 2022 16:13:20.793 # Error trying to save the DB, can't exit.\r\n27790:M 22 Feb 2022 16:13:20.793 # SIGTERM received but errors trying to shut down the server, check the logs for more information\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nredis-server should terminate while still loudly complaining.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nRedis 5 behaves as I expect - it terminates on SIGTERM even if the directory doesn't exist.",
