  "title": "2.6 Denial of Service via EVAL loadfile()",
  "body": "Confirmed on both the 2.6 and unstable branches. \n\nIt is possible to create a denial of service condition using loadfile. It seems that loadfile should not be available for atomic / security reasons?\n\n```\neval \"return loadfile('/dev/random');\" 0\n```\n\nThe timeout for scripts is not honored when this condition is entered as well.\n\nPlatform 11.10 64bit\nInstalled using simple make && make install\n\nCould not replicate on OSX as the above command returns immediately, however loadfile is still available and can be used to enumerate files and directories.\n\nWhile possibly not helpful I did run make test and here is the output\n\n!!! WARNING The following tests failed:\n\n**\\* [err]: Protocol desync regression test #1 in tests/unit/protocol.tcl\nRedis did not closed connection after protocol desync\nCleanup: may take some time... OK\nmake[1]: **\\* [test] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/baldwnad/redis/src'\nmake: **\\* [test] Error 2\n",
