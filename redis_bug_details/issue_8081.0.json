  "body": "**\"No such file or directory\" error**\r\n\r\nwhen we want to use redis unixsocket it is possible that given path for socket does not exist.\r\nin this situation if we start redis-server with  given config, error occurred with this message:\r\n**Opening Unix socket: bind: No such file or directory**\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior and/or a minimal code sample.\r\nyou can delete unixsocket path and start to run redis server.\r\nfor example change unixsocket path to /var/run/redis/redis.sock and delte /var/run/redis path.\r\nnow in redis directory execute this command : src/redis-socket redis.conf\r\n![error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70946432/99932016-f29c1d00-2d6b-11eb-9423-bfc57612d2d3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior **\r\nredis most check unixsocket path and check if it does not exist create related path recursively.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\ni created new pull request and push my solution.\r\n",
