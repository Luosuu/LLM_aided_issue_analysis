  "title": "[BUG] rdbWriteRaw retval overflow",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/rdb.c#L97\r\n`rdbWriteRaw` input parameter len is type `size_t`, but return an `int`.\r\nIf we write data over `2GB`, the `retval` of `rdbWriteRaw` will overflow. And may cause rdb format error.\r\nSuch as:\r\nhttps://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/rdb.c#L447\r\nThe `rdbSaveLzfStringObject` will return a big negative number, but we just cover the situation of `n==-1` and  `n>0`.\r\nIf `rdbWriteRaw` overflow, the string will be written twice, the first is compressed, the other is plain. The rdb format will \r\nmismatch and cause serverpanic on loading rdb.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nEven if the redis limit size of string and bitmap less than 512M, there are some modules could exceed the limit.\r\n\r\nI found this problem by using [RedisBloom](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom).\r\nThere is the same [issue](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/257) caused by this bug.\r\n",
