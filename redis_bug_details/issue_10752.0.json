  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nHi, I found a possible memory leak in streamGetEdgeID with static analysis. \r\n\r\n`si` is initialized by `streamIteratorStart()`, the code doesn't `streamIteratorStop()` on it when things done.  it's a memory leak.\r\nhttps://github.com/redis/redis/blob/60250f50c2f308d301fb0bfcb6d07faa2560ce60/src/t_stream.c#L393-L405\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the doc of `streamIteratorStart()`, we need to call `streamIteratorStop()` when things done. \r\nhttps://github.com/redis/redis/blob/60250f50c2f308d301fb0bfcb6d07faa2560ce60/src/t_stream.c#L1037-L1058\r\n\r\nThanks for your further confirmation.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior and/or a minimal code sample.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nA description of what you expected to happen.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nAny additional information that is relevant to the problem.\r\n",
