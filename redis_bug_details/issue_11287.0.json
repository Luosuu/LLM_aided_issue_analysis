Redis is running Lua 5.1.5 and so not effected.\r\n\r\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-33099 - As describe in the CVE, effects 5.4.2 up to 5.4.4 so again Redis is not effected.\r\n\r\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15888 - I run the [example](http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2020-07/msg00053.html) mentioned on the CVE, on Lua 5.4.0 to to make sure I can reproduce the crash (as expected, it crashes). I run the same example on Lua 5.1.5 and it runs. I also tested with valgrind.\r\n"
