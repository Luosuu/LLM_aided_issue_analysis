  "title": "[BUG] Sentinel configurations are mixed on 2 different architectures with same network segment and port",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nI am trying to perform a version upgrade without impacting the connected applications, but in several tests I have performed the old and new architecture end up mixing in an inexplicable way. Each architecture consists of:\r\nOld architecture\r\n172.18.0.2:6380 -- master\r\n172.18.0.3:6380 -- slave\r\n172.18.0.2:26379 -- sentinel1\r\n172.18.0.3:26379 -- sentinel2\r\n172.18.0.4:26379 -- sentinel3\r\nNew architecture \r\n172.19.0.2:6380 -- master\r\n172.19.0.3:6380 -- slave\r\n172.19.0.2:26379 -- sentinel1\r\n172.19.0.3:26379 -- sentinel2\r\n172.19.0.4:26379 -- sentinel3\r\nI mean that both architectures have their configuration files and work perfectly independently, however the change I am trying to make is by changing the traffic through a NAT IP, which stops sending traffic to the old architecture and sends it to the new one.\r\n\r\nBut when that happens, the sentinels of the new architecture for some reason receive the information from the old architecture, get a new master, and the sentinels.\r\nSo the configuration after the network change:\r\n2 masters, 2 slaves, 6 sentinels.\r\n√≥\r\n1 master, 3 slaves, 6 sentinels\r\nThe network change is the only change I make, but somehow the sentinels are messing with me by sharing configurations.\r\nI think I can solve this by bind, or by changing the ports, but I wondered if anyone else has gone through the same thing?\r\n\r\nA short description of the bug.\r\nSentinels share configurations and from 3 sentinels per architecture merge to be 6. \r\n**To reproduce**\r\n it is necessary to make a network hop with a NAT IP\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior and/or a minimal code sample.\r\nThe strangest thing that happened is that one of the sentinels had the following configuration and yet it was filled with the information from the master and the other sentinels\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed8e95f7-b962-45da-ae84-48e270445e60)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThat after the IP NAT change the configurations are not changed or mixed,\r\n\r\nA description of what you expected to happen.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nAny additional information that is relevant to the problem.\r\n",
