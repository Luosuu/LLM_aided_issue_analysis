  "title": "[BUG] RediSearch with JSON.MERGE",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nI found a new bug when using Redisjson and RediSearch, prob.\r\n\r\nWhen I update a certain value (That is also indexed using RediSearch) using `JSON.MERGE` and search for it using `FT.SEARCH` with the old value, it still returns results. However that's not the case when using `JSON.SET`, it works perfectly fine.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_20230528-174806~2](https://github.com/redis/redis/assets/91954685/e0f5d561-7b3f-4209-83bf-6ba0652db89f)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nIt was supposed to not return anything \r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nAny additional information that is relevant to the problem.\r\n",
