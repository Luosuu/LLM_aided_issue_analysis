      "body": "Hi @ramblehead ,\r\n\r\nThank you for reporting the issue, as per the 7.0 code it's having space as expected. here is the reference : https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/8e73f9d34821a937165884f13a2981883f44a074/redis.conf#L316C1-L316C1\r\n\r\nalso in my mchines /etc/redis/redis.conf it's supervised is auto:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# When Redis is supervised by upstart or systemd, this parameter has no impact.\r\ndaemonize yes\r\n\r\n# If you run Redis from upstart or systemd, Redis can interact with your\r\n# supervision tree. Options:\r\n#   supervised no      - no supervision interaction\r\n#   supervised upstart - signal upstart by putting Redis into SIGSTOP mode\r\n#                        requires \"expect stop\" in your upstart job config\r\n#   supervised systemd - signal systemd by writing READY=1 to $NOTIFY_SOCKET\r\n#                        on startup, and updating Redis status on a regular\r\n#                        basis.\r\n#   supervised auto    - detect upstart or systemd method based on\r\n#                        UPSTART_JOB or NOTIFY_SOCKET environment variables\r\n# Note: these supervision methods only signal \"process is ready.\"\r\n#       They do not enable continuous pings back to your supervisor.\r\n#\r\n# The default is \"no\". To run under upstart/systemd, you can simply uncomment\r\n# the line below:\r\n#\r\nsupervised auto\r\n\r\n# If a pid file is specified, Redis writes it where specified at startup\r\n# and removes it at exit.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill check on my machine again by re-installing and confirm. If possible can you give the steps you followed that would be easy for me to reproduce."
