  "title": "[BUG] CLIENT KILL doc descriptor wrong",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nThe `command docs` info for `CLIENT KILL` has an incorrect duplicate name between `ADDR` and `LADDR`. (And `SKIPME` is suspect.)\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n\r\nRun `command docs` and inspect the details. In particular notice that `ADDR` and `LADDR` have the same `name` - `ip:port`. These names would be expected to be `addr` and `laddr`, but at minimum they must not be the same, because then parsing driven from this data can't tell the difference.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$11\r\nclient|kill\r\n...\r\n$9\r\narguments\r\n..\r\n$10\r\nnew-format\r\n..\r\n$4\r\nname\r\n$7\r\nip:port\r\n$4\r\ntype\r\n$6\r\nstring\r\n$5\r\ntoken\r\n$4\r\nADDR\r\n...\r\n$4\r\nname\r\n$7\r\nip:port\r\n$4\r\ntype\r\n$6\r\nstring\r\n$5\r\ntoken\r\n$5\r\nLADDR\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other weird one is `SKIPME` use of name `yes/no`, instead of expected `skipme`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nname\r\n$6\r\nyes/no\r\n$4\r\ntype\r\n$6\r\nstring\r\n$5\r\ntoken\r\n$6\r\nSKIPME\r\n```\r\n",
