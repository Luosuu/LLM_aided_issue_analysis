  "title": "[BUG] redis-cli exit codes are inconsistent",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nredis-cli exit code can be `1` or `255` on failure. Looks like it's inconsistent, not sure when to expect one or another.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nThis is how `255` is returned:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/redis/redis/blob/b69636d377cce0eb8c1fae3ac80240387e31d78f/src/redis-cli.c#L9048\r\n\r\n`noninteractive()` returns `REDIS_ERR` on failure, which is `-1`, it becomes `255` as exit codes are in range `0-255`. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nAs far as I see, nothing is wrong by doing this but it'd nice to be consistent. If we want to have a quick fix and use exit code `1` on all cases, we might be introducing a breaking change? I'm not sure if anybody relies on this. \r\n\r\nAlso, we had a quick conversation with @yossigo, we may further improve error codes by using different exit codes for different error cases as well. \r\n",

      "body": "@oranagra I agree with you %100 user should check `!= 0` and I feel like it should be okay to change `255` exit codes to `1`. \r\n\r\n@yossigo thought returning `255` instead of `1` on connection failure would be a breaking change, so I created the PR. \r\n\r\nNow, thinking the other way around,  if we fix places and return `1` instead of `255`, would that be a breaking change as well? \r\n\r\nAs you said people should check `!=0`, even they don't do that, they should be okay with `1` as it is the generic error code. `255` is considered out of range error code IIUC, it's definitely not something to rely on, so I believe we can change it to `1`.\r\n\r\n@yossigo wdyt?"
