      "body": "I dug into this more--I compiled it directly for the target device (no docker anymore) and get the same issue. `strace -f` shows `[pid 26537] openat(AT_FDCWD, \"/proc/self/smaps\", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)` being the root of the issue. It seems my kernel is not compiled with `CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR`, which provides /proc/self/smaps.\r\n\r\nI would be content with an added warning something like \"your kernel is not compiled with CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR, so unable to check for this kernel bug. Check if your kernel contains ff1712f953e27f0b0718762ec17d0adb15c9fd0b, then set ignore-warnings: ARM64-COW-BUG in your config\"\r\n\r\nObviously ideally there is a way to do this without CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR, but I understand that my usecase of running redis on a router is a bit unique :)"
