  "title": "[BUG] Layout/Responsiveness Issue: Page Elements Not Scrolling Consistently",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen scrolling down the page on the 'Libraries and tools' section and similar  of the Redis website (https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/), I've noticed an issue with the page layout or responsiveness. The middle portion of the page, including the search bar and content below, scrolls as expected. However, other elements like the top navbar and some parts of the page remain static and do not scroll consistently with the rest of the page\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n- Visit the 'Libraries and tools' page on the Redis website (https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/).\r\n- Scroll down the page.\r\n- Observe that the middle section scrolls, but the top navbar and some other parts of the page remain static.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nWhen scrolling down the page, all elements should scroll consistently and maintain their positions relative to the viewport.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2567-05-24 at 1 39 05â€¯AM](https://github.com/redis/redis/assets/89733575/855f5f8c-4763-4901-b3d9-2c31b182d3cf)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
