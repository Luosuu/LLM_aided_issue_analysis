      "body": "Hello @danielhtshih \r\n\r\nThe issue you're experiencing is due to the fact that your database already has a key with the same name but of a different type. You can check the key's value type with the [`TYPE`](https://redis.io/commands/type) command.\r\n\r\nClosing this as a non-issue - please feel free to reopen if you disagree."
