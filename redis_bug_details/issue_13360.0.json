  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen clicking URL from below message in WSL2 Ubuntu:\r\n\r\n```\r\n204972:C 21 Jun 2024 21:49:20.946 # WARNING Memory overcommit must be enabled! Without it, a background save or replication may fail under low memory condition. Being disabled, it can also cause failures without low memory condition, see https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/1328. To fix this issue add 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' to /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run the command 'sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.\r\n```\r\n\r\n![CMD Screenshot](https://github.com/redis/redis/assets/31812582/104e60d9-ac41-4e9e-a683-5feda62d2c3e)\r\n\r\nIt opens the URL with period at end in browser:\r\n\r\n![Browser Screeshot](https://github.com/redis/redis/assets/31812582/485a1fd2-7e8c-4cd1-b2e3-a3d99038086a)\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nUse `redis-server --daemonize yes` in WSL2 Ubuntu\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nIt should open `https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/1328` instead of `https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/1328.`\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nIts probably has to do with how Windows Terminal detects links. One way to fix this would be to add space before period in `/src/syscheck.c` file where this message is defined. I am not sure if it goes against the style guidelines or its not to be fixed from redis side but from Windows Terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
