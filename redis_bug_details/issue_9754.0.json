  "title": "[BUG] loading redis streams with maxlen from .rdb",
  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've noticed that upon loading a stream key with a maxlen from a rdb file, that stream key no longer allows one to push new data to the stream.\r\n\r\nMeaning that after I reload that rdb file, and try to add new data to that same key, via a the client , the client crashes. However one can read from the stream.\r\n\r\nIf I delete that key from the rdb file, and try again. The client still crashes.\r\n\r\nMy only workaround has been to use rdb tools to copy the rdb file into a fresh instance.",
