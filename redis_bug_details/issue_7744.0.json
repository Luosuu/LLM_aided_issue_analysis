  "title": "[BUG] Redis-cli 6.0.7 fails mass-insertion with \"unknown command\" by apparently misreading stdin",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen using the latest version of redis-cli available on homebrew (6.0.7) mass insertion of ~800k ZADD commands fails by apparently misreading (or misexecuting)  commands. Likely mixing multiple commands together, resulting in random errors related to 'bad syntax' when no errors are actually present in the file. This same mass-insertion, with the same data, does not fail in redis-cli 6.0.5.\r\n\r\nCommand:\r\n```bash\r\ncat myFile.txt | redis-cli --pipe\r\n```\r\nNote the non-existent command `ZAADD` instead of the actual written command `ZADD`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nERR unknown command `ZAADD`, with args beginning with: `ac:ngram:wachovia `, `0`, `wachovia bank nj`\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nCreate a huge file executing multiple ZADD statements, and the occasional HMSET (around 800k should do it.)\r\n```txt\r\n.\r\n.\r\nZADD \"ac:ngram:weyerhaeuser co wa\" 0 \"weyerhaeuser co wa\" \r\nZADD \"ac:ngram:weyerhaeuser co wa\" 0 \"weyerhaeuser co wa\" \r\nZADD \"ac:ngram:weyerhaeuser co wa\" 0 \"weyerhaeuser co wa\"\r\nHMSET \"ac:results:abmps wa\" title \"ABMPS, WA\" zip \"98667\" \r\n.\r\n.\r\n```\r\nRun the command to mass-insert this file using redis-cli (6.0.7)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncat my-800k-line-file.txt | redis-cli --pipe\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nMass insertion should execute line-by-line and not accidentally mix any commands or lines together.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that this was reproduced on two diff macbook pro's running hombrew installed redis, and executed from zshell.\r\n",
