  "body": "I was trying to take database dump using:\r\n```\r\nredis-cli --csv BGSAVE\r\nCURR_DATE=$(date +%s)\r\nwhile true; do\r\n\t# LASTSAVE returns epoch of last successfull background dump process\r\n\tLAST_SAVE=$(redis-cli  --csv LASTSAVE)\r\n\t[ \"$LAST_SAVE\" -ge \"$CURR_DATE\" ] && break || sleep 30\r\ndone\r\n```\r\nIt did not exit from `While loop`, because LAST_SAVE did not change and it tried to save data into disk,but it failed\r\n\r\n**Reason:**\r\n Their was not an available Storage space, and Redis was trying to put new dump data.\r\n\r\n**Suggestion:**\r\nTheir should be a `time out` with error message `Server out of disk`, and program should exit with error code",

      "body": "Hello @AhmedMItman \r\n\r\nI don't agree this is a bug with the cli. Your script could be improved to detect a faulty save by calling `INFO persistence` and looking at the 'rdb_last_bgsave_status' field.\r\n\r\n> Their should be a time out\r\n\r\nWhat time out? Both `BGSAVE` and `LASTSAVE` return immediately.\r\n\r\n>  with error message Server out of disk\r\n\r\nThe error is output to the log.\r\n\r\n> and program should exit with error code\r\n\r\nWhich program?"
