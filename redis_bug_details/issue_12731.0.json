  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nI want to setup Redis sentinel in my AKS based on the Bitnami Helm Chart (https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/redis/18.1.2). After deploying the Sentinel Container spams the message: \r\n\r\n`waitpid() returned a pid (996) we can't find in our scripts execution queue!`\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\nI am using an Image with the following Dockerfile:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM redis:7.0-alpine3.18\r\n\r\nRUN apk add --no-cache bash\r\nRUN apk add openssl\r\n```\r\nI am using the following YAML to deploy the Redis Sentinel with the above shown Image in the StatefulSet.\r\n\r\n[YAML.zip](https://github.com/redis/redis/files/13267038/YAML.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nRedis and Sentinel are Running without these Logs shown in additional information.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nTo make it clear i am NOT using the officall Bitnami Image shown in the Helm Chart docker.io/bitnami/redis:7.2.1-debian-11-r0 / docker.io/bitnami/redis-sentinel:7.2.1-debian-11-r0 because those critical CVEs in the images are not allowed in my environment.\r\n\r\nSome Logs from the Pod\r\n\r\n[1.log](https://github.com/redis/redis/files/13267090/1.log)\r\n[2.log](https://github.com/redis/redis/files/13267091/2.log)\r\n[3.log](https://github.com/redis/redis/files/13267092/3.log)\r\n",

If i take a look into all my logs also into the logs linked in my post i never saw something like TILT in my logs. Thats the point why i am confused. How can we check the TILT mode do i need to configure something?"
