  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nRedis will clear `/proc/PID/environ` in `setproctitle`. The content for redis server process's `/proc/PID/environ` is empty by default.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n1. clone the repo\r\n2. `make`\r\n3. `./src/redi-server`\r\n4. `ps -ef | grep server` to get the PID\r\n5.  `cat /proc/PID/environ`\r\n6. \r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`/proc/PID/environ` should not be emptyed or we should add a macro to control whether we want to enable `setproctitle` feature.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nAny additional information that is relevant to the problem.\r\n",
