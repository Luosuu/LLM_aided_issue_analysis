      "body": "There are 5 commands that don't declare keys and operate on the keyspace: \"SCAN, RANDOMKEY, KEYS, FLUSHALL, FLUSHDB\". Extending your expected outcome, we should perform this validation for all of these 5 commands, which I don't think is reasonable or all that feasible. So I see two options:\r\n1. These commands can only be executed if you have all keys permissions. This is a backwards breaking change, and not sure I really like this.\r\n2. We introduce an @all-keys category, which we can recommend you explicitly remove."
