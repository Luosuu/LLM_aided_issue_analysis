  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nIn Redis 6.0.9 snapshotting was disabled if there was no `save` directive in the config file. This is consistent with the docs: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/6.0/redis.conf\r\n> Note: you can disable saving completely by commenting out all \"save\" lines.\r\n\r\nIn Redis 6.2-rc1 snapshotting seems to be enabled even with no `save` directive in the config file.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n```\r\necho > redis-config\r\ndocker run -v $(pwd)/redis-config:/redis-config -p 6379:6379 redis:6.2-rc1-alpine redis-server /redis-config\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor VARIABLE in {1..200}; do redis-cli set one two; done\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nDon't expect to see after 5 mins:\r\n> 100 changes in 300 seconds.

      "body": "There used to be a bug (#5629) in which passing any command line configuration (which is probably happens in docker) would reset the default save config.\r\n\r\nThis bug is now fixed in 6.2, and the behavior change is mentioned in the release notes:\r\n```\r\n* Not resetting \"save\" config when Redis is started with command line arguments. (#7092)\r\n  In case you provide command line arguments without \"save\" and count on it\r\n  being disabled, Now the defaults \"save\" config will kick in.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default behavior of redis (when just lunched like `./redis-server`) was that it has a default save, and that's always been the case.\r\n```\r\nsrc/redis-server &\r\n...\r\nredis-cli config get save\r\n1) \"save\"\r\n2) \"3600 1 300 100 60 10000\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it seems like the documentation in redis.conf is simply incorrect, and that but i mentioned above made it look correct, but only in certain scenarios.\r\n\r\n@itamarhaber maybe you have something to contribute here? can we just update redis.conf doc line?"
