Start Redis with RedisBloom.so module https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom\r\n2. Create a bloom filter `BF.RESERVE test 0.01 100 EXPANSION 1`\r\n3. Run `BF.EXISTS test 1` and use `sudo tcpdump -A -nn -i any port 6379 | grep 'BF.EXISTS' -a10 --color` to capture network package\r\n4. Change to Another Redis version and repeat step 1-3\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nBoth of two version of server should return the same RESP content, but their did not.\r\n7.0.4:`: RESP \"0\"`\r\n7.0.11:`: RESP \"#f\"`\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nAny additional information that is relevant to the problem.\r\n",
