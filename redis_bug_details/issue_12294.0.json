      "body": "It's not a leak if it doesn't grow over time, or isn't kept after the process no longer needs it... \nI.e. we never bother releasing memory before terminating the process, that's just a waste of time with no benefits.\nAlso, FYI, valgring doesn't warn on memory not released at exit, only at allocations that doesn't have any references to them."
