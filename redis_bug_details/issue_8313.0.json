Thanks"

I don't know how that happens and what triggers it, because it is running for couple of days correctly. Even if I restart a random sentinel or redis instance, a new redis master is assigned and all the sentinels are working as intended.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on how can I troubleshoot this, so I can help gather more info and report it?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I just saw the PR. I will try and build + deploy it."
