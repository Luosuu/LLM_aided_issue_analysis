Steps to reproduce: I can't figure out !\r\n\r\nBut prior to the crash, I suspect my node app _maybe_. My app logged:\r\n> READONLY You can't write against a read only replica.\"\r\nwhere stupidly I lost the whole log (thanks to my stupid deployment).\r\n\r\n## What I did\r\nI deleted all db files of my Redis volume on Docker, but it didn't work (same error).\r\n\r\n## My app\r\nIn my app, all I do is basic operations that didn't cause any issues before but I suspect one loop though that I run on bootstrap:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction purgeKeys(redisDB) {\r\n    console.log('Redis purge is running')\r\n    var stream = redisDB.scanStream({ match: '*' })\r\n    stream.on('data', function (resultKeys) {\r\n        if (resultKeys.length) {\r\n            stream.pause()\r\n            redisDB.unlink(resultKeys).then(() => {\r\n                stream.resume()\r\n            })\r\n        }\r\n    })\r\n    stream.on('end', function () {\r\n        console.log('all keys have been visited')\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo instead of doing this, I dropped removed persistence by Docker by removing volumes. But then I got the same error !!!",
