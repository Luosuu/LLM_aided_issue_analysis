  "title": "[BUG] RediSearch with location is showing outside of search radius ",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nI'm using RediSearch to search through documents that contain coordinates. When I run a radius search, I am occasionally getting results that are located a short distance outside of the search distance. \r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nCreate a document with an indexed set of coordinates. Add entries with these coordinates:\r\n(37.35141,-79.18003)\r\n(37.35141,-79.18003)\r\n(37.35722,-79.17139)\r\n(37.43583,-79.16883)\r\n\r\nRunning the following query should return the first 3 entries, but not the fourth. Those coordinates are approximately 5-6 miles from the center of the search.\r\n\r\n`ft.search indexName \"@coords:[37.34060346114586 -79.17873661760095 2 mi]\"`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nRunning the query should show the first 3 entries, as they are the only ones inside the search radius. \r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nI've got this query hooked up to a map, so that it refires as I move the center and adjust the zoom level to show me what's on the map based on the current screen. I've also noticed some results (in a larger data set) blinking in and out during those adjustments when they should still be visible on the map. But the 4th search result above doesn't show up on the map because it's too far away and off screen, but it's coming back in the query results.\r\n\r\nI have not attempted to reproduce this with standard Redis GeoSpatial data and searching outside of the `ft.search` command.",
