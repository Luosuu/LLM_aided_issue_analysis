  "title": "[BUG] redis-shutdown doesn't use tls-port",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen configured with TLS, the `redis-shutdown` script ignores the TLS port number\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nStart Redis with `port=0` and `tls-port=6379`. `redis-shutdown` attempts to connect to server on port 0 and fails.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe TLS configuration should be recognized, and `redis-cli` should be passed the `--tls` option as well as the correct port number.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\n(This script seems pretty dated, also doesn't work with ACL users.)\r\n\r\nI got it working with TLS by changing one line and adding two others:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPORT=`awk '/^[[:blank:]]*(tls-)?port/ { print $2 }' $CONFIG_FILE | tail -n1`\r\nTLS=`awk '/^[[:blank:]]*tls-port/ { print $2 }' $CONFIG_FILE | tail -n1`\r\n...\r\n[ -z \"$TLS\" ] || ADDITIONAL_PARAMS=\"$ADDITIONAL_PARAMS --tls\"\r\n```",
