  "title": "[BUG] requirepass just doesn't work",
  "body": "When I set the requirepass property by adding it to the root conf (or by setting custom conf) or by adding it upon startup \r\n(`redis-server --requirepass `) it doesn't work, the cli says that there is no password set. But when setting it through the cli, it does work.\r\n\r\nI know this sounds really simple/stupid, but I've tried many things, this just doesn't seem to work for some reason.\r\n\r\nI am using a fresh install of redis-server 6.2.6 on Ubumtu 20.04 through WSL2.",
