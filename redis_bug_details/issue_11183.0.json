  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nI have setup cluster in a single container on ports 7000-7005.\r\nWhen trying to connect via redis_insight, \r\n1- The redis_insight connects via service name of docker-compose,\r\n2- The redis cluster issues move command to another node (host and port, eg 127.0.0.1:7003) which is not accessible to services outside of this container.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nSetup cluster in a single container on ports 7000-7005.\r\nTry connecting via redis_insight or any other service, It won't connect.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nIt should be able to connect via exposed ports and internal MOVE command should bind to host, not 127.0.0.1\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nI am following this approach: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8BkmdZzxDg",

      "body": "When you say \"MOVE command\", do you mean \"MOVED redirect\"?\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the ports 7000-7005 are not exposed outside of the container, so therefore the client can't access them. You can make docker expose these ports on the host's network by running docker with `--net=host`."
