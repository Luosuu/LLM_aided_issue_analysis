  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nXREADGROUP block longer than timeout.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. create stream\r\n```\r\n> XGROUP CREATE stream group $ MKSTREAM\r\n```\r\n2. client one\r\n```\r\n> XREADGROUP GROUP group c1 BLOCK 0 STREAMS stream >\r\n```\r\n3. client two\r\n```\r\n> XREADGROUP GROUP group c2 BLOCK 10000 STREAMS stream >\r\n```\r\n4. client three, 5 seconds after step 3. (immediately client one was unblocked and got the message.)\r\n```\r\n> XADD stream * field value\r\n```\r\n5. 10 seconds after step 4, client two was unblocked showing that timeout is 15 seconds.\r\n```\r\n> XREADGROUP GROUP group c2 BLOCK 10000 STREAMS stream >\r\n(nil)\r\n(15.03s)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nclient two's timeout should be 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nI think client two was signaled in step 4 and reprocess `XREADGROUP` command again, making timout to reset.\r\n",
