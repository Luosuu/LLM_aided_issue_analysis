Output below\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> ACL SETUSER windsor on allcommands ~com::royalendicott::windsor::* &com::royalendicott::windsor::* >windsor\r\n(error) ERR Error in ACL SETUSER modifier '&com::royalendicott::windsor::*': Adding a pattern after the * pattern (or the 'allchannels' flag) is not valid and does not have any effect. Try 'resetchannels' to start with an empty list of channels\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> ACL SETUSER windsor on allcommands ~com::royalendicott::windsor::* >windsor\r\nOK\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> ACL SETUSER windsor &com::royalendicott::windsor::*\r\n(error) ERR Error in ACL SETUSER modifier '&com::royalendicott::windsor::*': Adding a pattern after the * pattern (or the 'allchannels' flag) is not valid and does not have any effect.
