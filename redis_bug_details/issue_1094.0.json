  "title": "Exit with error if RDB / AOF file names are actually paths",
  "body": "Redis is designed to persist in the configured basedir (`dir` config directive).\nHowever currently it accepts full paths for AOF / RDB file names, leading to errors if the specified path is in a different device, since it can't rename cross-device.\n\nSo to fix all this issues we should perform additional checks and exit if the specified file names are actually absolute or relative paths.\n",
