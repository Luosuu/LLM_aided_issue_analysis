  "title": "[BUG] REDISMODULE_ARGV_RUN_AS_USER might leak allocated RM_Call argv on failure",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nIn exploring other things, I think REDISMODULE_ARGV_RUN_AS_USER will leak argv on failure in RM_Call().  \r\n\r\nnamely, moduleCreateArgvFromUserFormat() will allocate it, normally it will be attached to c->argv and then freed when client is reset, but in the case of a REDISMODULE_ARGV_RUN_AS_USER() failure, that will never happen.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nhaven't reproduced yet, just visual/logical analysis.",
