  "title": "[BUG]Sentinels doesn't select one master node when all nodes are declared as master node",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nI am using Bitnami's redis helm chart(redis:6.2.7) to deploy my redis (3 nodes + 3 sentinels) in kubernetes. Normally there will be 1 master node and 2 slave nodes.\r\n\r\nHowever, after restarted the Kubernetes cluster, all 3 redis nodes are selected as master node. \r\nIt is pretty much like a brainsplit, but still those 3 nodes are trying to sync RDB and AOF data from each other.\r\n\r\nAnd sentinels seems didn't detected this situation.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\nForcely  restart kubernetes cluster could reproduce this issue with a chance like 20%.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSentinels notices this situation and automatically failover 2 of the 3 masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
