A user can only be defined once in config files\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "thanks for the report. i see the problem, @madolson Do you have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nfrom redis.conf:\r\n```\r\n# Include one or more other config files here.  This is useful if you\r\n# have a standard template that goes to all Redis servers but also need\r\n# to customize a few per-server settings.  Include files can include\r\n# other files, so use this wisely.\r\n#\r\n# Note that option \"include\" won't be rewritten by command \"CONFIG REWRITE\"\r\n# from admin or Redis Sentinel. Since Redis always uses the last processed\r\n# line as value of a configuration directive, you'd better put includes\r\n# at the beginning of this file to avoid overwriting config change at runtime.\r\n#\r\n# If instead you are interested in using includes to override configuration\r\n# options, it is better to use include as the last line.\r\n```"

      "body": "CONFIG REWRITE doesn't really play well with include files.\r\nfor most configs, it'll just add duplicate lines, and the last one simply overrides the earlier ones (as noted by the above quote),\r\nbut for ACL we recently traded that with an error, see #9330.\r\n\r\nsince the rewrite code doesn't have any visibility of the include files (and will certainly not modify it), i think we should just argue that ACL should be managed by an `aclfile`, and if not then at least the plain config file, and mixing it in include files and config rewrite is unsupported."
