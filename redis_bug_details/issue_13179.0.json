  "title": "[BUG] Usability regression due to commit 0b34396",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nThe commit in 0b34396 modified the license which makes redis unusable for my personal projects. This is a serious regression, and I would like to encourage that commit to be reverted.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nClone the latest version of redis. The license is no longer open source.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nAn open source project should have an open source license, such as BSD-3\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nThe fork at https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey has this bug fixed. I would like to encourage the redis authors to consider the same solution.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking into it.",
