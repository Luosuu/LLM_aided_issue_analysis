  "title": "[BUG] SET with GET option: WRONGTYPE Error",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nSetting with the `GET` option returns an error, but still sets the value. Is this intentional?\r\n\r\n`getGenericCommand` can [return an error](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/c85bf2352d2a3dd04872124d33066403b114a7e7/src/t_string.c#L204-L206) if the value is not a string. However, `setGenericCommand` [does not check](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/c85bf2352d2a3dd04872124d33066403b114a7e7/src/t_string.c#L93) this return value. It seems to me that the operation should be aborted at that point.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1:6378> hset x 1 2\r\n(integer) 1\r\n127.0.0.1:6378> set x 2 get\r\n(error) WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value\r\n127.0.0.1:6378> get x\r\n\"2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe operation is aborted and the key is not set.",
