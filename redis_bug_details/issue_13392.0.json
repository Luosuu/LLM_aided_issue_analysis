  "title": "[BUG] scheduled to be closed ASAP for overcoming of output buffer limits when using HSCAN command",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWe're using GCP redis (14GB single instance, v6.2.13, basic Tier), and have 1k HASHes in db, some with over 1mln of keys. \r\nWe're doing a lot of `HSCAN` to download all keys of single HASH, with 10k or 100k of keys in a row. We noticed that sometimes Redis client (python client`redis = \"^5.0.7\"`) gets `Connection lost` or `[Errno 104] Connection reset by peer`. \r\nIn Redis server logs we see:\r\n```\r\n1264:M 04 Jul 2024 00:14:30.597 # Client id=3346328 addr=10.196.25.81:57062 laddr=10.150.67.219:6379 fd=6581 name= age=0 idle=0 flags=N db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=-1 qbuf=93 qbuf-free=40861 argv-mem=58 obl=16383 oll=2 omem=41008 tot-mem=102546 events=r cmd=hscan user=default redir=-1 scheduled to be closed ASAP for overcoming of output buffer limits.\r\n```\r\nwith repeating `omem=41008` value, and it's always connected with HSCAN command. \r\n\r\nIf I understand this section https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/clients/#output-buffer-limits correctly having some bytes in Output Buffer is unexpected for normal clients but I'm not sure if it's a problem with server or client (however client sends plain `HSCAN` command without any extra effort). I wanted to adjust that limit (to test if it will help) but it's not supported in GCP instance. \r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nNot sure, maybe having big HASHes and doing HSCAN on them often? In last 30 days we had 1644 logs with this issue (for over 1mln of scans), sometimes retires helps but not always. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nOutput buffer is empty when doing HSCAN and we're not failing this command by client.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\nI can correlate those errors with failed snapshot with \r\n```\r\n1264:M 02 Jul 2024 22:31:15.840 # Background saving terminated by signal 9\r\n```\r\nlogs\r\n",
