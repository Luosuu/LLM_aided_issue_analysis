  "title": "[BUG] slave vote for  twice in 2*timeout  will won election",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nsuppose we have a slave change the role frequently,   like slave->master->slave->master\r\nIn principle, if a slave node is elected as a master, it cannot succeed in the second election within twice the time, but in our test, if it becomes a slave and initiates another election, then it can succeed in the election ,  without asking for votes and  self-increasing epoch。\r\n\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\nsuppose  cluster timeout is  15s;   the node1 of port 51002 is master ,  the node2 of port 51003 is slave\r\n\r\nredis-cli -p 51003 cluster failover\r\nsleep 14s;\r\nredis-cli -p  51002 cluster failover\r\nsleep 14s;\r\nredis-cli -p  51003 cluster failover\r\nsleep 14s;\r\n\r\nthen node1 has initiated two elections round  in 2*timeout,  and both round  it has wonned election,  but can not change to master , it will fullsync again as a slave role  , the egative impact is that the slave will fullsync again\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nif node has initiated two elections round in 2*timeout ，if it win in first time,   it should not win election  in second time\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\nLOG:\r\n4018:S 07 Apr 2021 17:08:15.364 # Manual failover user request accepted.\r\n4018:S 07 Apr 2021 17:08:15.364 # Received replication offset for paused master manual failover: 112\r\n4018:S 07 Apr 2021 17:08:15.364 # All master replication stream processed, manual failover can start.\r\n4018:S 07 Apr 2021 17:08:15.364 # Failover election won: I'm the new master.\r\n",
