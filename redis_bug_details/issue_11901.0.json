  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\n`bzpopmin foo 0.001` should have blocked for 1ms. Instead it blocks forever\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n`bzpopmin foo 0.001`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI expected it to block for just 1ms and return nil\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\n`bzpopmin foo 0.0011` blocks for about 1ms. When 0 is passed it is supposed to block indefinitely. It looks like it is doing something strange. \r\n\r\n",
