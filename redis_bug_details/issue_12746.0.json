  "title": "[BUG] redis-cli no longer supports implicit default username in connection URL",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nIt used to be possible to connect to Redis using redis-cli and a connection URL with an empty username, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nredis-cli -u 'redis://:PASSWORD@localhost:6379/0'\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this no longer seems to work with the `redis-cli 7.0.12` I'm using right now and it responds with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAUTH failed: WRONGPASS invalid username-password pair or user is disabled.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found that this can be fixed by explicitly providing `default` as username as follows (by luck, since that doesn't appear to be documented anywhere):\r\n\r\n```\r\nredis-cli -u 'redis://default:PASSWORD@localhost:6379/0'\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, that seems to somewhat violate the backwards compatibility promise as described [here](https://redis.io/docs/management/security/acl/).\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nSee description.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSee description.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n",
