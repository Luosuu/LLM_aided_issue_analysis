      "body": "Redis stack is a separate offering from redis, and it's maintained https://github.com/redis-stack/redis-stack. Redis stack is mostly just a distribution of Redis with some modules, so not sure what is going on. I would create the issue over there first though, please re-open back here if they determine it's something related to Redis.\r\n\r\nWorth noting it's \"Connection reset by peer\" and not `connection refused`, so a port is up and listening."
