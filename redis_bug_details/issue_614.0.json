  "title": "Lua script multi-element LPUSH / BRPOPLPUSH replication bug",
  "body": "I noticed a replication bug while attempting to use Redis as a reliable queue with a Lua script pushing multiple elements onto the queue. It appears the wrong number of RPOP operations are sent to the slave instance, resulting in the queue on the slave growing unbounded, out of sync with master.\n\nI created an example repo to demonstrate this behavior:\n\nhttps://github.com/sickp/redis-lua-repl-bug\n\nThis affects Redis 2.5.12 (and 2.5.11, likely early versions as well).\n",
