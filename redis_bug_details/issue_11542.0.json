      "body": "I'm not sure I quite follow. You pass in `data/redis` as the `--dir`, which changes the relative path to that directory. So in your example, you're setting the unix socket and pid to `data/redis/data/redis` since you're first changing the relative directory and then passing in further relative directory arguments. \r\n\r\nI have a suspicion the pid file is also failing to be written, but we aren't logging any error in that case since it is considered a best effort failure. I made a small patch to fix that, https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11544, but I'm still of the opinion that there is no other issue. "
