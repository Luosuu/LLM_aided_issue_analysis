Issue happens when repeated multiple times\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe return of the two commands should be consistent\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nThe sentinel node with this problem entered and exited the tilt mode, I don't know if it is related\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12031110/173022497-6dc89335-25c3-425d-aa61-3e7e4e94d2a3.png)\r\n\r\n",
