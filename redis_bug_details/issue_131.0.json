  "title": "System/user CPU accounting in INFO is wrong",
  "body": "I think there is a minor issue in the statistics returned by the INFO command:\nthe system and user CPU values are reversed (i.e. system CPU is put instead of user CPU\nand vice versa).\n\nIn redis.c:\n\n```\n    \"used_cpu_sys:%.2f\\r\\n\"\n    \"used_cpu_user:%.2f\\r\\n\"\n    \"used_cpu_sys_children:%.2f\\r\\n\"\n    \"used_cpu_user_children:%.2f\\r\\n\"\n```\n\n...\n        (float)self_ru.ru_utime.tv_sec+(float)self_ru.ru_utime.tv_usec/1000000,\n        (float)self_ru.ru_stime.tv_sec+(float)self_ru.ru_stime.tv_usec/1000000,\n        (float)c_ru.ru_utime.tv_sec+(float)c_ru.ru_utime.tv_usec/1000000,\n        (float)c_ru.ru_stime.tv_sec+(float)c_ru.ru_stime.tv_usec/1000000,\n\nSuggested fix:\njust reorder the rusage values, so that the order of the returned fields is kept as it is today\n(but with their correct values).\n\nRegards,\nDidier.\n",
