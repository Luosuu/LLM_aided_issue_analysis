  "body": "In `redis-cli.c`, the function `clusterManagerNodeMasterRandom` has the following [code](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/redis-cli.c#L4683):\r\n\r\n```\r\nint master_count = 0;\r\nlistIter li;\r\nlistNode *ln;\r\nlistRewind(cluster_manager.nodes, &li);\r\nwhile ((ln = listNext(&li)) != NULL) {\r\n    clusterManagerNode *n = ln->value;\r\n    if (n->flags & CLUSTER_MANAGER_FLAG_SLAVE) continue;\r\n    master_count++;\r\n}\r\n\r\nsrand(time(NULL));\r\nidx = rand() % master_count;\r\n```\r\n`master_count` is used as a divisor and it may be zero if it is never increased in the loop, leading to a potential divide by zero bug.",

(even if that's true, seems like invalid use of the cli).\r\n\r\nThanks for the clarification. This is an issue found by static analysis tool. I think in this case it does not harm to check the value of `master_count` and return `NULL` when it is zero."

      "body": "We can add\r\n\r\n    assert(master_count > 0);\r\n\r\n[Edit] Also, I think the `/* Can not be reached */ return NULL` at the end of the function should be replaced by `assert(false);`. Where the function is called, we don't check for NULL, so I think it's better that it can never return NULL."
