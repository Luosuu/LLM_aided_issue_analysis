      "body": "@remicollet I totally agree with you on this, this fix slipped through to 6.0.9 and would have been better off delayed to 6.2. We do our best to be mindful and avoid such mishaps, and at the same time not be too strict and keep a reasonable cadence. Sometimes we get it wrong, like in this case."
