  "title": "[BUG]Makefile dependency errors",
  "body": "We recently conducted a study to detect build dependency errors, focusing on missing and redundant dependencies.\r\n*Missing dependencies (MDs), are dependencies that are not declared in the build script but will be used in the full build.\r\nMDs prevent GNU Make from recompiling programs after they have been modified and regenerating all the targets that contain them, resulting in incorrect incremental builds\r\n*Redundant dependencies (RDs), are dependencies that are declared in the build script but will not be used in the full build.\r\nRDs refer to static build dependencies which declare dependencies that are not the actual build dependencies of the target. RDs cause the build system to perform unnecessary incremental builds. In addition, RDs cause targets that could be executed in parallel to be executed sequentially, reducing the build efficiency.\r\nWe analyze the actual software construction process and detect dependency errors.\r\nWe have detected the following dependency errors in your public project. Please help us to check these dependency errors. \r\n\r\nCommit ID: 395d801a\r\n[dep_error_395d801a.csv](https://github.com/redis/redis/files/12877562/dep_error_395d801a.csv)\r\n",
