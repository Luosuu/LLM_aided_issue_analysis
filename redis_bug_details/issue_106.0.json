  "title": "Even when maxmemory is reached Redis should allow MULTI/EXEC blocks containing only commands allowed on out of memory.",
  "body": "Currently we have this strange behavior:\n\n```redis 127.0.0.1:6379> set foo bar\nOK\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> config set maxmemory 10\nOK\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> set foo2 bar2\n(error) ERR command not allowed when used memory > 'maxmemory'\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> multi\nOK\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> get foo\nQUEUED\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> exec\n(error) ERR command not allowed when used memory > 'maxmemory'\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> \n\n```\n\nAs you can see Redis is preventing us from running MULTI/EXEC even if the block only contains read-only commands.\nThis bug should be fixed preventing the MULTI/EXEC block execution only if the memory limit is reached AND there is at least a command flagged as REDIS_CMD_DENYOOM.\n\nI'm fixing this issue in the **unstable-ctable** branch.\n```\n",
