  "title": "[BUG] UNWATCH should be rejected within a MULTI/EXEC transaction just like WATCH is",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nCurrently, if one attempts to do a WATCH within a transaction, it fails.\r\n\r\n`ERR WATCH inside MULTI is not allowed`\r\n\r\nHowever, if one does an UNWATCH within a MULTI/EXEC transaction it doesn't fail, but also has zero effect (i.e. its only executed at exec time when the dirty/cleanliness of the client's WATCHes was already decided.  So, one just either get a nil back (EXEC was aborted due to WATCH being dirty) or one gets a pointless \"OK\" back in the response array where the UNWATCH was issued.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\ninsert an UNWATCH into a MULTI/EXEC transaction.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nShould be rejected similarly to WATCH.",
