  "title": "[BUG] Missing check for string length in redis-check-aof.c leads to integer overflow.",
  "body": "In the file redis-check-aof.c, we have the following [code](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/761d7d27711edfbf737def41ff28f5b325fb16c8/src/redis-check-aof.c#L78):\r\n```\r\nint readString(FILE *fp, char** target) {\r\n    long len;\r\n    *target = NULL;\r\n    if (!readLong(fp,'$',&len)) {\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* Increase length to also consume \\r\\n */\r\n    len += 2;\r\n    *target = (char*)zmalloc(len);\r\n    if (!readBytes(fp,*target,len)) {\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe variable `len` is read from the file. It could be a large value (e.g., `LONG_MAX`) such that `len += 2` may result in integer overflow. Moreover, since signed overflow is undefined behavior in C, it should be avoided anyway.",
