      "body": "@OronMA i'm not sure i understand your problem.\r\nit's not clear which interface you're using to pass these commands to redis, and if `\"\"` is an empty string, or maybe redis get's a missing argument or an actual `\"`.\r\nalso, please state which version of redis you're using.\r\n\r\nanyway, there are two behaviors:\r\n1 when redis can predict the command is gonna fail during queuing (like arity errors)\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> multi\r\nOK\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> incr a\r\nQUEUED\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> expireat a\r\n(error) ERR wrong number of arguments for 'expireat' command\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> exec\r\n(error) EXECABORT Transaction discarded because of previous errors.\r\n```\r\n2 when redis can't predict ahead of time, and ends up executing the command:\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> multi\r\nOK\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> incr a\r\nQUEUED\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> expireat a a\r\nQUEUED\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> exec\r\n1) (integer) 1\r\n2) (error) ERR value is not an integer or out of range\r\n```\r\n\r\nI consider both of them valid, and would note that invalid arguments are a bug in the software that should be fixed during development, and the transaction atomicity issues (failing one command and executing another), are something that could be avoided by using WATCH (e.g. to avoid missing keys or ones with wrong type)."
