      "body": "~~Some of my thoughts.~~\r\n~~In practice, when keyspace notify is used, most clients should be using the same pattern to listen, so it would be too much cpu overhead to iterate through all users' patterns.~~\r\n~~Maybe we should add a new `pubsubtype` (e.g `pubSubNotifyType`) to send keyspace notifications by traversing the `serverPubSubChannels` by pattern, instead of traversing all users.~~\r\nMisunderstanding, please ignore me.\r\n"
