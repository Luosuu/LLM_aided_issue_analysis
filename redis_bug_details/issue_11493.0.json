  "title": "[BUG] HSET Integer Reply",
  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nThe integer reply for HSET is not correct.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n`HSET hash field1 value1 field2 value2` \r\n`(integer) 3`\r\n\r\nThe returned integer should be 2, since 2 fields were added. Instead of counting the number of fields, it prints 2n-1 for n fields.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nHSET with more than one field/value pair.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nHSET should print `(integer) n` for n fields added.\r\n",
