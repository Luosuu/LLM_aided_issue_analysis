  "title": "[BUG] afterErrorReply() is not thread safe",
  "body": "In case of modules, ThreadSafeContexts can use `RM_ReplyWith*` family functions from threads. If `RM_ReplyWithError()` is called, it might lead to a call to `afterErrorReply()` first and then `incrementErrorCount()` . Inside this function, `server.errors` table will be accessed/modified without synchronization with the main thread or other threads. \r\n\r\nProblematic call stack would be : \r\n```\r\nA call for a thread-safe context : \r\n\r\n1- RM_ReplyWithError()\r\n2- addReplyErrorFormat()\r\n3- afterErrorReply()\r\n4- incrementErrorCount()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIntroduced by https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/8217\r\n\r\n",
