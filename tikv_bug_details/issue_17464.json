Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nTiKV \r\nRelease Version:   8.2.0\r\nEdition:           Community\r\nGit Commit Hash:   6e50b27980d7d2795c2d662c7a11d03d81d4b64d\r\nGit Commit Branch: HEAD\r\nUTC Build Time:    2024-07-09 08:09:03\r\nRust Version:      rustc 1.77.0-nightly (89e2160c4 2023-12-27)\r\nEnable Features:   memory-engine pprof-fp jemalloc mem-profiling portable sse test-engine-kv-rocksdb test-engine-raft-raft-engine trace-async-tasks openssl-vendored\r\nProfile:           dist_release\r\n\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nX64\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. TiDB cluster with log backup enabled, log is backed to local minio server\r\n2. Run workload and log backup lag ~3m\r\n3. Inject minio network latency 50ms for 10m.\r\n4. Check PiTR lag\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nPiTR lag might increase somehow, but should move forward.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nLog flush is very slow as single thread is used to upload log files. backup checkpoint hard to advance\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e45086e4-a0df-45e8-a296-5e42619557aa)\r\n\r\n",
