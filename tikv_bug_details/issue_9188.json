  "title": "The unified pool cannot schedule kv_scan, raw_scan and analyze requests well",
  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n\r\nTiKV 4.0 or master\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSet TiKV to use the unified thread pool for both storage and coprocessor. Run a TP workload. Then, run large kv_scan requests.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nThe unified thread pool should let the kv_scan request not affect TP workload.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nIt affects the performance of the TP workload now. Even if the priority of kv_scan is set to low, it can still affect TP performance.",
