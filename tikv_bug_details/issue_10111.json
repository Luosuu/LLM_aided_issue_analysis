Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nv4.0.9-v4.0.13,  v5.0.0, v5.0.1\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\ndoesn't matter\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\ndoesn't need special operation\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\ntrigger split check when needed\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\ndoesn't trigger split check sometimes\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/9081 introduced a new task in the split checker whose name is `GetRegionApproximateSizeAndKeys`. https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/eb2ed7f64efa95f3b80890f795127c1d61a292a7/components/raftstore/src/store/fsm/peer.rs#L3563-L3573 However, the code above has an assumption that if the `approximate_size` is not `None`, the split check has been done before, which is not true now.\r\nSo if the region has no enough write cmd to trigger the threshold(`compaction_declined_bytes` or `size_diff_hint`), it may not be split no matter how large it is.\r\nFurthermore, restarting TiKV can not solve this problem because the leader will call `heartbeat_pd` and update its `approximate_size` after a while then split check will be skipped.",
