  "title": "Pessimistic prewrite may be not idempotent on CommitTsTooLarge",
  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nConsidering the following case:\r\n1. All prewrites of a pessimistic async-commit transaction succeeds at first. But the client does not receive the responses of non-pessimistic keys.\r\n2. Some keys of the transaction are committed because of async lock resolve.\r\n3. In the retried prewrite for a non-pessimistic key, the calculated `commit_ts` exceeds `max_commit_ts`. Then, it returns async commit fallback to the client and successfully prewrites the lock.\r\n4. The client executes a legacy percolator commit.\r\n\r\nThis may cause several possible problems.\r\n\r\n- If the primary lock is committed in step 2, the final commit may fail (TxnLockNotFound). The end user may receive an error while the transaction commits successfully.\r\n- If the non-pessimistic key is committed in step 2, the final commit may commit this key twice, causing different commit TS for a single transaction.\r\n\r\nThis might be related to https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/34875.",
