Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nnightly\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\nI used br to restore about 500GB data into a fresh cluster with partition-raft-kv enabled. After br finished I found there were about 1200 sst filed under the import dir with a total size about 55GB. And after 24h, these sst files were still not cleaned up.\r\n\r\nAnd when I restart the cluster I could see a lot of ingest sst operations in the tikv log. This also make the restart much longer than expected before the foreground qps is stable.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nNo or little sst files should be left for a long time after br restore.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n",
