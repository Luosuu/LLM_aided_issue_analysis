Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nmaster: 2b983187b8108770f06a684dc5a32629314bf1a8\r\nThis bug may be related to https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/8869\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\nEnable encryption and import 14K warehouse tpcc data to TiDB. Then tikv was killed by oom-killer. TiKV failed to restart because of ingesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nI think tikv did not remove the ingest file from key-manager correctly.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16376959/100086255-22d8de00-2e88-11eb-8e27-e9e5cc409aad.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16376959/100086349-4439ca00-2e88-11eb-99fd-cae6ac59a690.png)\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16376959/100086160-f755f380-2e87-11eb-9568-d879d3ec1288.png)\r\n",
