Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nmaster\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\nnot releated\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\n1. Partition the leader and followers.\r\n2. Propose a write request on the leader.\r\n3. A new leader is elected and commits a new entry.\r\n4. Recover the network partition.\r\n5. The old proposal should be dropped and the committed_cb shouldn't be invoked.\r\n\r\n### Root cause\r\nAll proposals are sent to the apply system even if some of them aren't committed. We can filter them.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14819777/99644816-5d5a0980-2a89-11eb-8313-7f8df51a715b.png)\r\n",
