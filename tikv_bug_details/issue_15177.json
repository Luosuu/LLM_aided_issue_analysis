  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nPlease answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)\r\n\r\n1. oltp workload\r\n2. upstream and downstream is tidb \r\n3. the dataset is a big-single table\r\n4. tidb version is 7.1.0 vs 7.1.1\r\n\r\n### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)\r\nThe insertion performance of large-scale tables in version 7.1.1 should be at least on par with version 7.1.0.\r\n\r\n### 3. What did you see instead (Required)\r\nVersion 7.1.1 exhibits performance regression in large-scale table insertion, accompanied by noticeable QPS fluctuations.\r\n![image](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/assets/85105033/76e5d3d8-1938-4e94-a60e-e05de85e3208)\r\n![image](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/assets/85105033/8f7c604a-d36c-4117-8493-72a661aae10b)\r\nfrom the below metrics we can see the duration of 7.1.1's prewrite and commit is slower than 7.1.0's\r\n![image](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/assets/85105033/aedf2bad-22f7-4554-a928-dcf479c26271)\r\nStorage Async Write Duration and Apply Duration experience sudden and significant increases.\r\n![image](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/assets/85105033/c7055a74-d88e-495d-88cd-bc067fabe022)\r\n![image](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/assets/85105033/95229e06-aeb0-4491-84bf-23b9cdba29ca)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)\r\nv7.1.0 and v.7.1.1\r\n<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->\r\n\r\n",
