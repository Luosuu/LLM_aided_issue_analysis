  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nLike #3572 and #8381, there is another case that there may be two same-term leaders.\r\n\r\nSee this case:\r\n1.  region A has peer 1, 2, 3 on store 1, 2, 3, respectively\r\n2. peer 1 is leader and peer 3 is isolated\r\n3. 1 proposes split cmd and region B is created.\r\n4. 1 proposes two conf change to remove peer 3 and add peer 4\r\n5. peer 3's network recovers and it will get a gc response from 1 or 2 then it will destroy itself.\r\n\r\nSo the peer of region B on store 3 is not created because peer 3 of region A does not apply the split cmd.\r\nBut the other peer of region B will consider this peer is a voter.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the problem of two same-term leaders may occur.\r\n\r\n",
