  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nmaster\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nRun tikv. Look at tikv log (e.g. deploy/log/tikv.log). Raftdb log are mixed with tikv log in the file.\r\n\r\nAfter #7358 we switch to use tikv logger instead of rocksdb native logger to dump logs. By default rocksdb logs (kvdb and raftdb) should be in their respective directories (e.g. deploy/data/db and deploy/data/raft). On master, however, raftdb log is printed into tikv log. kvdb is fine though.\r\n",
