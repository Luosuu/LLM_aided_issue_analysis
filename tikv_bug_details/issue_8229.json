  "title": "MvccTxn can't make use of near_seek",
  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n`MvccTxn` always uses `seek` to find write records. The reason is `MvccReader` in it always creates a new write cursor:\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/11cbf057ba8dec3a0833a9948b5ae9ec54d6113d/src/storage/mvcc/reader/reader.rs#L129-L145\r\n\r\nIt's better to use `next` to get older versions in some cases. For example, in https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/7024, you can see 578k seeks per second. Please be careful with prefix seek in rocksdb, it can't guarantee a total order of all keys, but only keys for the same prefix.",
