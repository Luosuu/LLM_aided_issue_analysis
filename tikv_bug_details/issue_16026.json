  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nnightly\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\nIn #15918 and #15929, we introduced auto-tuned quota limiters to controlled the resource usage of tasks with different priorities, this was aimed to ensure the qps and latency on high-priority tasks over low-priority tasks.\r\n\r\nBecause we uses async quota-limiter on tasks, in scenarios that the task concurrency is large and the applied quota-limiter is small, it is possible a lot of tasks will be pending in future-timer after the first poll on waiting for quota ready. While these tasks will count for the counter of `tikv_unified_read_pool_running_tasks`, they can cause the read-pool directly return `Full` error on incoming tasks(with higher-priority) even though there is no other ready tasks to be handle.\r\n",
