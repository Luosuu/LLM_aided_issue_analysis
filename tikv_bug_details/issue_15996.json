Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\nEnable Titan and prepare some data with Sysbench wide-table prepare\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nStore size on TiKV nodes are roughly same\r\n### What did happened?\r\nStore size is different due to different compression rate \r\n![img_v2_f8214297-59d9-4d5a-a583-1ece61f62c0g](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/9442422/e8f1ad86-b7a2-44ad-8460-6cb40e071461)\r\n\r\nThe reason is the compression rate of RocksDB data and Titan data is different. And each node's Titan data percentage is different which is by design. \r\n",
