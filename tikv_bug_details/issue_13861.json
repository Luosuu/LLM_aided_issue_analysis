Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n\r\nc1aceb003b9da06b75b70a1e545d52b994ab67dc\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n\r\nDoesn't matter.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nFlashback after https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/13823 will prewrite and commit the `start_key` to block the `resolved_ts`, but since the `start_key` passed in by TiDB could be an illegal key, e.g, without the `row_id`, which will make the TiFlash panic as https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/6379#issuecomment-1331758294 said.\r\n",
