  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\nWhen deleting ranges as well as write to memory enigne, we will free the lock to avoid blocking other operations. However, we are missing mechanism to handle the concurrency between these two operations, which results in dirty data when loading a range.\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\nbuilt on [bbc4af3](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/16868/commits/bbc4af3404a21ed418a088a4edc35eaefedf7441)\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
