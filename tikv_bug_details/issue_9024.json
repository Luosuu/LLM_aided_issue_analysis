Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\nPD worker is blocked by `get_region_approximate_size` for a long time if there are some huge regions. We have met a cluster with a few huge regions (around 50~60 GB), the cluster is not functioning normally to PD schedule (add peers/transfer leader) due to PD worker is blocked.\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\nv4.0.7\r\n\r\nFlamegraph\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/overvenus/87185107dc291d397021706b013d5ad4",
