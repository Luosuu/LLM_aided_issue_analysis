      "body": "@yiwu-arbug and I confirmed that the reason: TiKV 5.0 skips the encryption of the file `CURRENT`, but didn't take upgrade into account. After restarting TiKV to 5.0, plaintext `CURRENT` will be written. but this information is not deleted in `file.dict`. When next restart, TiKV will read a plaintext file as an encrypted file."
