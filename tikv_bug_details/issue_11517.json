Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nv5.3\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nDoesn't matter.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nI didn't reproduce the issue, it's reported in code review.\r\n\r\n1. Deploy TiKV servers with alert manager\r\n2. Load sysbench to TiKV to make apply thread CPU usage reach 180%.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nAlert manager alerts.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nNothing happen. Because the alert rule is wrong. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/2bbdc8dd880fef973558155c0260b144b28a0897/metrics/alertmanager/tikv.rules.yml#L166\r\n\r\nThe name of apply thread has changed to `apply_$number`, so the rule should be changed to\r\n```\r\nmax(rate(tikv_thread_cpu_seconds_total{name=\"apply_.*\"}[1m])) by (instance) > 0.9\r\n```",
