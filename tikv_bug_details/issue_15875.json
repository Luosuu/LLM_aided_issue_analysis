      "body": "Root cause：too much cost on transferring leader, resulting in too-long scheduling.\r\n\r\nReferring:\r\n1. PD scheduler details:\r\n![350ab475-1ea1-4e3a-84aa-a2feb1d676d5](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/18441614/cc02e71b-939b-42b0-93ff-fd7da82ef074)\r\n\r\n2. PD logging on slow transferring leaders:\r\n![46f0517d-12cb-4668-843d-0e95d9684049](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/18441614/d05f72d5-8a6d-482c-a9bd-f28118492866)\r\n\r\nFYI, in general, in synchronous I/O mode (when store-io-pool-size is set to 0), the slowness in data transfer is often caused by the Raftstore leader being stuck in writing previous Raft logs. This leads to a delay in processing the \"transfer leader\" message until the preceding writes have been flushed to disk. The duration of this delay, whether it is long or short, depends on the number of Raft logs waiting in the Raftstore's queue to be written at that moment."
