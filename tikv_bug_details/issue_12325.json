Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nCurrent master.\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n`Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6240 CPU @ 2.60GHz`\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nJust simply try to upload a local file with size greater than 5MB via the following code:\r\n```rust\r\n        let reader = File::open(data_file.local_path.clone()).await?;\r\n        let reader = UnpinReader(Box::new(limiter.limit(reader.compat())));\r\n        // some code omitted...\r\n        let ret = storage.write(filepath, reader, est_len).await;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nThe upload should success.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nIt failed with message *entity size is too small*.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nAccording to the document of S3, this error happens when the `PutObjectPart` request uploads a part smaller than 5M.\r\n\r\nHowever, the local file I/O in my system would read 16K each time(I guess), so the multi-part upload would upload many 16K parts too.\r\n\r\n![uhS7ufqzNW](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36239017/161894294-9c91f869-78dc-4ed9-b479-db77645ea3c2.png)\r\n",
