      "body": "The root cause is clear.\r\n\r\nThere exists one bug in DataKeyImporter::add(...):\r\n- When trying to add one file with a new key_id into DataKeyManager, the whole flushing of the new DataKey and the updating onto the file_dict_file is not atomic. That is, related operations in the file_dict_file might already be flushed into disk although the flag sync == false, without flushing related new DataKey into key_dict_file.\r\n- Only when commit , the new DataKeys will be flushed into key_dict_file.\r\nHowever, in the test case, it mock the scenario where one of nodes in the whole cluster is crashed (by kill) repeatedly. And there might be one case where one tikv does not flush the new DataKey timely, but the tikv crashed. Then, the restart of this node will load all encrypted file metadata without the new DataKey, causing the crashing finally.\r\n![image](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/18441614/5763c5ce-0a09-4450-860d-1c3ade1ff8b0)\r\n\r\n"
