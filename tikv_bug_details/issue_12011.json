  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n`cb5cb230e77665e017853ce9292162c5fd250cbb`\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n1. use tiup to deploy a cluster (1tidb, 1pd, 3tikv)\r\n2. use tidb-lightning to load 14k tpcc data into this cluster\r\n3. run sysbench prepare for 10 * 1billion data\r\n4. patch tikv to a newer nightly version\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nThe rolling restart should be successful\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nTiup up report start tikv-server time. In the tikv-log in see it cost nearly 500s to recover raft-engine.\r\nOne of the raft-engine contains more the 4000 files and the total file size is >400Gb, the other two raft-engine file sizes are <10Gb.\r\n",
