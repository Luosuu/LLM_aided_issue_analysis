  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nCurrently TiKV cleans up destroyed ranges for write cf and default cf by [ingesting SSTs](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/45fcb0812a0437cabce2436c5223c96c9de83d5e/components/raftstore/src/store/worker/region.rs#L593).\r\nThose ingested SSTs may introduce too many compactions on L0, make compactions on L1~Ln slower. Then the size of LSM tree grows up continuously, the space of disk may run out in some extreme cases.\r\n",

      "body": "The purpose of the original optimization (https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/7794) is to reduce write amplification, but seems it's not effective when the SST is ingested to L0 and even could cause some bad effects. So I suggest putting delete through a WriteBatch if the SST can only be ingested to L0."
