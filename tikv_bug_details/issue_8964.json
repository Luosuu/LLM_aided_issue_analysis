      "body": "### Bug\r\n\r\n#### 1. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) (optional) \r\n<!-- Write down the reason why this bug occurs -->\r\n\r\nTiDB pushes down the check of uniqueness to TiKV when prewrites, however, TiKV checks write conflict and data constraint before lock's existence. It can report a duplicate entry error when there is a lock belonging to a committed transaction that deletes the key.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Symptom (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- What will the user see when this bug occurs. The error message may be in the terminal, log or monitoring -->\r\n\r\nFail to insert a row due to duplicate entry error and no corresponding row is in the table.\r\n\r\n#### 3. All Trigger Conditions (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- All the user scenarios that may trigger this bug -->\r\n\r\n1. A transaction deleted one row with unique indexes, and locks on unique indexes are left.\r\n2. Another transaction inserts a row with the same unique index in optimistic transaction mode or autocommit mode.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Workaround (optional)\r\nUse pessimistic transaction mode. However, the lock behavior of deletion in pessimistic transaction mode is not correct because TiDB doesn't lock unique indexes. It can report a duplicate entry error if insertion and deletion are concurrent. This bug will be fixed in v4.0.9 too.\r\n\r\n#### 5.
