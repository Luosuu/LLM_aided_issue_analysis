  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n6.5.1\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\n9 tikvs for voter role, 3 tikvs for learner role, tispark read from learner roles.\r\ntispark job is `select * from a_big_table(3T,single replica)` and the learner tikv cpu is about 80% during the spark job\r\nThe spark job takes about 30 minutes and failed for the error of `Coprocessor task terminated due to exceeding the deadline` occasionally.\r\nMaybe we can refine ther retry logic for the coprocessor timeout in the tispark or tikv.\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nspark job success\r\n### What did happened?\r\n",

      "body": "@lilinghai Did you try to increase the https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/dev/tikv-configuration-file#end-point-request-max-handle-duration in TiKV?\r\nAfter this change, if it's still unable to solve this issue, then it's probably related to client side coprocessor timeout.  We're making client-side timeout value configuration in configuration file. \r\nhttps://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/45298\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/client-go/pull/865"
