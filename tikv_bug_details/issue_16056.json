Begin a task, with one store has a temporary connective issue to PD.\r\n2. Wait.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nThe log backup task should either:\r\n- Fail.\r\n- Run normally.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nThe log backup lag increases to infinity. Until we evict all leaders in the store failed to connect to PD during loading the task.\r\nIt reports the log (thankfully...) and did nothing more.\r\n```\r\n[2023/11/07 19:29:51.821 +00:00] [WARN] [errors.rs:171] [\"\"backup stream meet error\"\"] [verbose_err=\"Etcd(...)\"] [err=\"...\"] [context=\"\"failed to register backup stream task log-scheduled-backup-manager to router: ranges not found\"\r\n```\r\n",
