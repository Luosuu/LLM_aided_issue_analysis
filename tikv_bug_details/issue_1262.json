  "title": "Mark tombstone immediately when applying a confchagne",
  "body": "When a peer is removed, its state should be updated to Tombstone immediately. Otherwise it may have risk to separate the cluster.\r\n\r\nFor example, a region has four peers A, B, C, D, E. Then it removes C and D. If E is isolated during that time, and C, D apply the conf change successfully but failing to save the Tombstone state. When E is recovered, its request vote will recreate C and D as replica peers again. Then E can become Leader. So cluster will be seperated into two parts: (A, B) and (C, D, E).",
