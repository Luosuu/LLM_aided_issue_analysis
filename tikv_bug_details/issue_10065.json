  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nmaster\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nDoesn't matter.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nUse high workload to make disk util nears 100%, and rolling update the cluster\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nRolling update should finishes in seconds.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nIt keeps timeout. The problem is region heartbeat needs to load approximate size and key count, which need to access disk. If disk is busy, then the heartbeat will not be sent out in time. Hence the operator always timeout.\r\n\r\nIf transfer leader task depends on region heartbeat, then region heartbeat should be lightweight enough to be reported, and should not require approximate size and key count be known. Or transfer leader should depends on other mechanism to detect if leadership has changed.",
