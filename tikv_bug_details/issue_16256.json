Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nmaster\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\ntitan cluster fallback to rocksdb\r\nDuring the GC process, a new blob file was generated but not yet added to the manifest. However, Titan restarted before it was added to the manifest, and a new manifest file with the same ID was created after Titan restarted. This resulted in the blob file not being cleaned up.\r\n![image](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/7677963/63f5538e-e9f2-4964-a5df-fa9912cc9e7d)\r\n\r\n[2023/12/29 11:20:37.276 +08:00] [FATAL] [[setup.rs:310](http://setup.rs:310/)] [\"invalid configuration: check: titandb-data-dir-empty; err: \\\"data-dir.empty.check: the number of file with extension blob in directory /var/lib/tikv/data/db/titandb is non-zero, got 1, expect 0.\\\"; hint: You have disabled titan when its data directory is not empty.
