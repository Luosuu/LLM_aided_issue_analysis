Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nv6.5.5\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\n- Run store-read workload.\r\n\r\n- Use this [fail_point](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/commit/7a610a0cff5d311bccdc4264d4df4ab104a2a7d6) to inject 5s delay, delete this error injection after 15 seconds.\r\n\r\nAs you can see the following metrics, there are many TiKV affected and the max resolve_ts gap getting bigger.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/26020263/1134ab8d-0f7e-457f-9af8-3493134665d3)\r\n<img width=\"1449\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/26020263/cbfb53b2-a183-4caf-b23d-8a7dcf23c3c9\">\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nOnly 1 TiKV affected which has fail_point inject.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nMany TiKV affected.\r\n",
