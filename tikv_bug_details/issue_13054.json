  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nAfter one store disconnected, StoreFsm would broadcast a `StoreUnreachable` message to all regions to mark unreachable peers. https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/0dff1be50281c72c55c5464751cd733032115ce4/components/raftstore/src/store/fsm/store.rs#L378\r\n\r\nBut if TiKV has too many regions, handling these `StoreUnreachable` messages could eat raftstore CPU and block all other messages, making TiKV getting stucked.",
