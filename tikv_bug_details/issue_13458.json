  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\nThe differences are introduced by [TiDB commit](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/commit/0482b2e83ed2fa6493b23fd7ab8415c9196f8885), which aligns TiDB castFloatAsTime behavior with MySQL. \r\nOne example:\r\ncast(49106.0 as datetime) = '2049-10-06 00:00:00' => cast(49106.0 as datetime) = NULL\r\nNow TiKV needs to be consistent with TiDB.\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n",
