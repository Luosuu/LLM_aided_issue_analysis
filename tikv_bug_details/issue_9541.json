Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nmaster\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nubuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. set up kms server such as localstack (https://github.com/localstack/localstack.git)\r\n2. create tikv config\r\n```\r\n[security.encryption.master-key]\r\ntype = \"kms\"\r\nkey-id = \"8c929cbb-b3b6-432a-b091-67f742be0666\"\r\nendpoint = \"http://localhost:4566\"\r\nregion = \"us-east-1\"\r\n\r\n[security.encryption]\r\ndata-encryption-method = \"aes256-ctr\"\r\ndata-key-rotation-period = \"7d\"\r\n```\r\n3. try to run pd-server and tikv-server\r\n```\r\n./bin/pd-server --name=pd --data-dir=pd --client-urls=\"http://127.0.0.1:2379\" --peer-urls=\"http://127.0.0.1:2380\" --initial-cluster=\"pd=http://127.0.0.1:2380\" --log-file=pd.log\r\n./bin/tikv-server --pd-endpoints=\"127.0.0.1:2379\" --addr=\"172.16.111.10:20160\" --data-dir=tikv --log-file=tikv.log --config=\"tikv.toml\"\r\n```\r\n4. view the tikv.log and found kms request error due to timeout.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\naccess kms service correctly.\r\n\r\nuse awslocal to test and found the service is enabled. And I created a real kms key to test, got same problem.\r\n",
