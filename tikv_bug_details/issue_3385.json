  "title": "Some Prevote tests cannot pass reliably.",
  "body": "In #3386 we determined that some prevote tests cannot pass reliably.\r\n\r\nThis is because we attach a `MessageTypeNotifier` which listens for a specific message type to be send in some duration.\r\n\r\nThe way we use it is by creating a failure, such as a partition, then recovering it and immediately attaching the notifiers.\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n\r\n* Attaching the notifiers before clearing the partitioning means we accidentally clear the notifiers as well.\r\n* Since the notifiers are attached after the partition is removed it's entirely possible that the prevote messages will be sent before we can go an attach the notifier.\r\n* It was manually verified even in failing test cases that a prevote was sent as appropriate.\r\n\r\nIn #3386 we disabled these unreliable tests, enabling them will require some thought around how to catch these messages.",
