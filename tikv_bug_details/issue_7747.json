  "title": "Fail to evict leader when rolling update a new hibernated cluster",
  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nIf there are too many leaders or transfer leader just goes too slow, rolling update a cluster can take too much time. If the cluster enables hibernate region at the time, it's possible that all updated nodes will not have any leader because updated leader becomes hibernated very quickly and outdated follower will start election when lost heartbeat from leader for a long time. So it becomes slower because more leaders need to be evicted during rolling update.\r\n\r\nA possible solution is to add a hibernate timeout configuration. Leader will not go to sleep before the timeout. So it's safe as long as the hibernate timeout is larger than the update time. And the timeout can be set to a smaller value after the cluster has enabled hibernate region on all nodes.\r\n\r\nAnother solution is make the configuration be changed online. So users can enable/disable hibernate regions whenever they feel safe.\r\n\r\nWe need to fix the issue in 3.0.x, 3.1.x and 4.0.",

      "body": "Another solution is using negotiation to decide whether enabling hibernate region. There are three rules:\r\n1. if configuration disables hibernate region, then peer disables hibernate region;\r\n2. if configuration enables hibernate region, leader should make sure all followers agree to hibernate before going to sleep;\r\n3. when a node is started, a peer should broadcast messages to wake up the cluster.\r\n\r\nIf a cluster enables hibernate region by rolling update, leaders in updated instances will only go to sleep when all followers are in updated instances because of rule 2. leaders in outdated instances will not go to sleep as hibernate region is disabled. So there will be no interruptions.\r\n\r\nIf a cluster disables hibernate region by rolling update, leaders in updated instances will not go to sleep because hibernate region is disabled. If all binaries are latest versions that including above policy, then leaders in outdated instances will not go to sleep because of rule 3 and rule 2. Otherwise it will still go to sleep and may cause unexpected elections.\r\n\r\nBecause of #9068, leaders requires all followers active to sleep already. So this approach doesn't introduce any regression."
