Later TiKV until at lease v5.3 should also be affected.\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n\r\nNot related.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nInject network abnormity to one TiKV instance in the cluster while some snapshots are sending.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nThe other TiKV instances with no network issues will work well.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nPD will not produce operators to these normal nodes because of too many \"receiving\" snapshot.\r\n\r\nHere is the snapshot metrics of a node without network issues. Its snapshot count in \"receiving\" state is incorrect.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17217495/139039461-079bb8ba-c0c9-48ef-8c21-67329f52090d.png)",

But if a network error occurs during the process, the deregistration will be missed. I think that's why the snapshot state count is incorrect."
