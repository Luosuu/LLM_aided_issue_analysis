  "body": "## Bug Report\r\nWhen creating a TiDB cluster with TLS support enabled (on server side), the metrics page of TiKV still uses plain HTTP to serve connections, while TiDB and PD are using HTTPS, so Prometheus can't scrape metrics in an unique way.\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n```\r\nRelease Version:   3.0.2\r\nGit Commit Hash:   a65d10c6f5fb62d3aafcab6cfdcd5b36c2b33d35\r\nGit Commit Branch: HEAD\r\nUTC Build Time:    2019-08-07 02:31:51\r\nRust Version:      rustc 1.37.0-nightly (0e4a56b4b 2019-06-13)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\nRunning in a Kubernetes cluster, but that doesn't matter.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
