Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\nTiKV coprocessor doesnâ€™t limit the concurrency of analyze-table/index/checksum, so the request duration is proportional to the concurrent request count due to the yatp which results in endless query timeout and retry until backoff times out.\r\n\r\nIn our internal test, we use lightning to load data and lightning sets the `tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency` to 100. The request duration is far from the handle duration due to the scheduling of yatp.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14819777/118225299-7206df80-b4b7-11eb-8e4b-dfa46f256977.png)\r\nThe running tasks keep increasing due to the retry mechanism in the client and consumes all CPU of the read pool.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14819777/118225321-7b904780-b4b7-11eb-84fa-802c3189029a.png)\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nLimit the concurrency of analyze/checksum like DAG does and cancel stale requests https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/10166.\r\n",
