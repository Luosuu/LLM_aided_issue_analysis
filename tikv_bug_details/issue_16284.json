Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nTiKV 7.1\r\nGO SDK: 2.1.4\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nNo idea,   It worked well for reading and writing Tikv with different clients ago two months\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nThe scan failed due to the range key not being decoded,  I guess the key range overlaps between raw client keys and txn client keys.\r\n```\r\nerrorVerbose=\"failed to decode region range key, key: \\\"3536306564663538306439663838632F6B762F6769642F74696D657374616D70\\\", err: invalid marker byte, group bytes \\\"b12/b2-86\\\"\\n(1)\r\n```\r\n",
