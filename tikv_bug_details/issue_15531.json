  "title": "The `need_restored_data` for multi value index should return false",
  "body": "In tidb, `need_restored_data` for multi value index should return false, as the `tp` will become `JSON` when it's marked as an array. I'm not sure whether it's good to modify `get_tp()` to return `json` for every type, but at least we should ignore the `RestoredData` for json, or it will report an error.",
