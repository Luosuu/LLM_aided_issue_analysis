      "body": "After region merge, TiKV creates a GcPeerRequest with wrong region id. This leads to a misleading GcPeerResponse, causing the target region leader to mistakenly think that the source peers have been garbage collected. As a result, the source peers are left abandoned indefinitely, leading to a stuck resolved ts.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/4a5fb7321ca2ee2bab0b31f6556c8fb196a590f4/components/raftstore-v2/src/operation/life.rs#L702-L711\r\n\r\nAfter merge, removed peer may come from source region."
