  "title": "raft-engine: panic on decoding unexpected bytes when starting.",
  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this bug is that there might exist errors when flushing block data of raft-logs into disk, which making the logs encounter an unexpected errors(such as, an abnormal value of size is recorded).\r\n\r\nAnd by design, we will automatically truncate these incorrect logs as default. But in 6.5.2(without this pr: [https://github.com/tikv/raft-engine/pull/295](https://github.com/tikv/raft-engine/pull/295,)), the incorrect header was incorrectly decoded and return to the following functions to decode the detailed LogItems, and then it finally caused the crash as the offset was abnormal.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nThe version of TiKV ranges from [v5.4, v6.4] and enables the `raft-engine` feature.\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\nAny.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\nIf the TiKV is panic when staring, and the stack shows that it's failed on decoding.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nTiKV starts normally as expected without panic.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nTiKV panic.",
