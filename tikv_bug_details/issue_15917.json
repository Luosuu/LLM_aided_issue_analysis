  "title": "Priority Scheduling Optimization",
  "body": "## Development Task\r\n\r\nCurrently, the tasks scheduling across different resource groups are handled via a priority queue, it works well when the task arrival   rate from different resource group are at a similar level. But still, low-priority resource group may consume more resource by send tasks at a much higher rate than other groups. Also our control between read & write is not very good as these two kind of tasks are running in two separate thread pool.\r\n\r\nIn order to handle this issue, we decided to apply a auto tuned quota-limiter to each priority, by adjusting the quota of each limiter periodically, we can adjust the resource usage of each priority level so we can avoid low-priority tasks consuming too many resources.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- Add Priority-level Quota Limiter\r\n- Add a background task to auto-tune each quota limiter\r\n- (maybe) Use unified-read-pool to replace txn-scheduler-worker-pool \r\n",
