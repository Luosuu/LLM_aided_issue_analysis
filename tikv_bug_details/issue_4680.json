  "title": "ReadIndex when transferring leader may not be correct",
  "body": "Note that when doing ReadIndex and there is already one pending, the new request will be append to queue directly.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/4285afc203e38f032657f96b2132dc2dcc655fc4/src/raftstore/store/peer.rs#L1671-L1677\r\n\r\nThis is sound as long as it holds that the lease of leader will be extended when pending ReadIndex is committed. However, when transferring leader, this is not true anymore. Lease can still be invalidate anytime after the pending one is committed.\r\n\r\n/cc @overvenus @siddontang ",
