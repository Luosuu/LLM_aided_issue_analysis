This should be one of the root case of so many memcpy in the profiling result.\r\n\r\nFollow up:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nprintln!(\"{}\", std::mem::size_of::<codec::Error>());\r\n// => 16\r\n\r\nprintln!(\"{}\", std::mem::size_of::<tikv_util::codec::Error>());\r\n// => 16\r\n\r\nprintln!(\"{}\", std::mem::size_of::<tikv::storage::Error>());\r\n// => 200\r\n\r\nprintln!(\"{}\", std::mem::size_of::<tikv::storage::mvcc::Error>());\r\n// => 184\r\n\r\nprintln!(\"{}\", std::mem::size_of::<tikv::storage::txn::Error>());\r\n// => 192\r\n```",
