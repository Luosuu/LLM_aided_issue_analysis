      "body": "This issue is caused by stale peer (see https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/10341), around `20:22` there are also injected network error, so that the improvement introduced by https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/10352 didn't work, thus the stale peer have to wait until `raftstore.max-leader-missing-duration` timeout (default 2h) then check PD and destroy itself. \r\n\r\nThe stale peer is peers that had been removed from the region but the peer itself didn't know that, thus TiDB won't send requests to it and the most damage is the misleading metric."
