The error in this case is\r\n```\r\ncomponents/encryption/src/encrypted_file/header.rs:18]: unknown version 2\r\n```\r\nIf so desire, we can apply a change to 4.0.x to make it able to downgrade, by making 4.0.x able to read the new file format, and rewrite the file into old format.

From the log point of view, it is obvious that the kms at that time could not be connected. This may be a problem of the dbaas environment itself at that time, rather than a logical bug. Can you elaborate on the environment and operation path at the time?\r\nMy operation path is create 4.0.8 version cluster -> upgrade to nightly.\r\n\r\n"
