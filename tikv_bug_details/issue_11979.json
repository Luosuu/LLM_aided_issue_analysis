  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nRelease Version:   5.1.3\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nLinux, ARM CPU\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nWhen running 5.1.4 testing on ARM, it is noticed that TiKV memory usage is very high right after the cluster is created if THP is enabled on the host, even if there is no workload running\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nTiKV memory usage should be normal if there is no workload running in the cluster, and it should not OOM easily.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n TiKV memory usage is about the memory quota set by the spec (16GiB) right after the cluster is created, then TiKV was OOM killed if there are other workloads like br restore.\r\n\r\n== THP is enabled on host (172.16.6.97) of downstream-tikv-0 pod, the TiKV memory status is weird for this TiKV pod. \r\n<img width=\"907\" alt=\"tikv_memory\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7403864/154253270-22035289-9be6-404b-bc89-3a695aec976e.png\">\r\n\r\n![pod_status](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7403864/154255127-a8d57619-e563-4170-9960-3672379d404e.png)\r\n\r\nFrom tikv.log, we can see there are lots of restart, many happens just when TiKV pod is started, and there is no workload. (we only do br restore to downstream tidb cluster after 2022/02/16 03:52:50.578 +00:00)\r\n```\r\n#grep Welcome tikv_downstream.log\r\n[2022/02/16 03:45:11.199 +00:00] [INFO] [lib.rs:81] [\"Welcome to TiKV\"]\r\n[2022/02/16 03:45:14.939 +00:00] [INFO] [lib.rs:81] [\"Welcome to TiKV\"]\r\n[2022/02/16 03:45:33.038 +00:00] [INFO] [lib.rs:81] [\"Welcome to TiKV\"]\r\n[2022/02/16 03:46:06.069 +00:00] [INFO] [lib.rs:81] [\"Welcome to TiKV\"]\r\n[2022/02/16 03:47:02.118 +00:00] [INFO] [lib.rs:81] [\"Welcome to TiKV\"]\r\n[2022/02/16 03:48:40.029 +00:00] [INFO] [lib.rs:81] [\"Welcome to TiKV\"]\r\n[2022/02/16 03:55:45.049 +00:00] [INFO] [lib.rs:81] [\"Welcome to TiKV\"]\r\n[2022/02/16 04:11:30.350 +00:00] [INFO] [lib.rs:81] [\"Welcome to TiKV\"]\r\n[2022/02/16 04:11:59.128 +00:00] [INFO] [lib.rs:81] [\"Welcome to TiKV\"]\r\n[2022/02/16 04:12:32.088 +00:00] [INFO] [lib.rs:81] [\"Welcome to TiKV\"]\r\n[2022/02/16 04:13:17.129 +00:00] [INFO] [lib.rs:81] [\"Welcome to TiKV\"]\r\n[2022/02/16 04:14:51.169 +00:00] [INFO] [lib.rs:81] [\"Welcome to TiKV\"]\r\n[2022/02/16 04:18:41.078 +00:00] [INFO] [lib.rs:81] [\"Welcome to TiKV\"]\r\n[2022/02/16 04:24:11.178 +00:00] [INFO] [lib.rs:81] [\"Welcome to TiKV\"]\r\n[2022/02/16 04:29:30.152 +00:00] [INFO] [lib.rs:81] [\"Welcome to TiKV\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n==TiKV log==\r\n[tikv_downstream.log](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/files/8079522/tikv_downstream.log)\r\n[tikv_upstream.log](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/files/8079532/tikv_upstream.log)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
