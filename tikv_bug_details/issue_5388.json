The sizes are 4, 8, 16, 32 respectively. QPS of both 8, 16, 32 are the same however the lease expire count increases when thread count increases.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/4a828f036fb1c92d2d5e4341089e77edf858bfde/components/raftstore/src/store/peer.rs#L3367\r\n\r\nAbove code expires the lease which cause the remote one expires (dropped) too, so every threads have to renew their leases by fallback to raftstore and get a new lease. Maybe it's better to just drop local one and keep the remote one, so that renewing remote lease only requires an atomic store.\r\n\r\n/cc @overvenus @5kbpers ",

      "body": "I think this happens because every thread in the read thread pool have a `LocalReader` and when the thread count increase, the number of read requests the `LocalReader` handled increase if the leader lease is expired the lease expire rate increase, the QPS did not change because `LocalReader` redirect request to `raftstore` but the store thread number not change. I think the key to handling this problem is to keep the leader lease not expired, maybe https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/9307 can improve it."
