  "title": "Rolling upgrade from 2.1 or older version to newer version may break region replicas consistency",
  "body": "## Bug Report\r\nDue to compatibility issues introduced in https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/3807, the new and old versions will behave differently for split operation. Therefore, during the upgrade process, when the leader of a region is of version 2.1 and the follower is version 3.0, if the region promotes learner after the split is initiated, the follower of version 3.0 will silently ignore the split operation. Thus, the follower's region epoch version will be smaller than the leader's region epoch version. When the leader transfers the leader to this follower, this new leader will always complain epoch not match because the epoch version is less than the epoch version stored by the PD. Eventually, the read, write, and scheduling requests of this region cannot succeed, and the region cannot provide services normally.\r\n\r\n### Phenomenon:\r\n\r\n- When rolling upgrade, the leader fails to transfer and can not provide service with the error of “get snapshot failed: EpochNotMatch”. \r\n- There are some regions always with pending peer\r\n\r\n",
