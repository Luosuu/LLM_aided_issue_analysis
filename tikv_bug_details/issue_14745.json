Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nthe current master\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nunrelated\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nRun `tidb-lightning` and make some region epoch changes between writing and ingesting.\r\nMore detailed:\r\n1. Upload a SST by `write`.\r\n2. But, don't ingest it.\r\n3. Scatter the region bound to the SST meta, make the store we are `write`ing  to no more has a peer of that region.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nAfter tidb-lightning exits, the SST file should be cleaned.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nEven time passed 5 days, the SST file hasn't been removed.\r\n",

      "body": "(Let's add the `affects-*` tags for 6.x firstly, I think this issue probably exists in the 5.x(even 4.x) versions. But it seems we haven't release patches over 5.x versions for a long time. So I guess it would be better to cherry-pick them when we are going to release new patch version?)"
