  "body": "Per @BusyJay:\r\n\r\n> I occasionally run into error when make dev:\r\n\r\n> > error: crate `librocksdb_sys` required to be available in rlib format, but was not found in this form\r\n\r\n> @Brian Anderson  Do you have any ideas?\r\n\r\nMy first guess is that this is a cargo pipelining bug, as it has only shown up recently and specifically happens with `make` (where pipelining is turned on). Reportedly the problem goes away by running `make` again, which also makes me think its likely a pipelining-related concurrency bug.\r\n\r\ncc @nrc \r\n\r\nSimilar report https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6993, closed as unreproducible.\r\n\r\nOur current toolchain is nightly-2019-06-14. Probably worth doing an upgrade just as a stab-in-the-dark.\r\n\r\ncc @alexcrichton\r\n",
