      "body": "> It looks like we can get the cluster id from the header, but how do I verify it?\r\n\r\nYes, cluster id is attached in the header.\r\n\r\n> At the moment I'm not quite sure how we should validate it? \r\n\r\nYou can add a new field (cluster_id) in `Service`. TiKV validates a request when TiKV receives it in `event_feed` gRPC handler.\r\n \r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/3f0c72a389b4987c27b3dc42d8931a7ecaff9638/components/cdc/src/service.rs#L275-L280 \r\n\r\n> Also, how can I reproduce it?\r\n\r\nI think adding a unit test that covers it is enough. It is not necessary to reproduce it in a real cluster. "
