  "body": "## Bug Report\r\nConsider this case:\r\n```\r\nmax-replicas = 5\r\ndc1 has two zones: zone1, zone2\r\ndc2 has two zones: zone3, zone4\r\ndc3 has one zones: zone5\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter dc2 is crushed, we want to improve the availability and change `max-replicas` from 5 to 3. But PD can't know it since it doesn't exceed the max downtime and may send remove peer command to dc1. This peer will be removed and the region becomes unavailable because we have 4 peers and 2 of them are down.",

But according to @BusyJay , that can't be done.\r\n* Even with joint consensus, the PD might try to remove both dc1 and dc3 peers, and still get an error.\r\n* The only solution is to not set `max-replicas` directly but to remove dc2 via `Placement Rules`, which guarantees that peers of other dcs will not be removed."
