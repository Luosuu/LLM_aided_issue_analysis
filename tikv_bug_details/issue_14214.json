Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nrelease-6.6\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n1) Sysbench prepare 150GB data per TiKV\r\n2) scale-out a TiKV on a 3 TiKV cluster , wait for 5 minutes\r\n3)  run Sysbench read-write workload\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nThe region balance speed is similar with or without sysbench workload\r\n### What did happened?\r\nThe region balance operator is not scheduled when there's moderate read-write workload. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"548\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-02-13 at 12 11 04 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9442422/218564577-ae34dca2-1c5d-484d-b239-b72fda1b6439.png\">\r\n<img width=\"804\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-02-13 at 12 11 46 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9442422/218564582-61bd3d77-6663-4a58-901d-c93b44beb1af.png\">\r\n\r\n",
