  "title": "In-memory engine: safe point may be larger than snapshot read ts",
  "body": "If we want to evict [k3, k6] from [k1, k10], we have:\r\n`historical_ranges`: [k1, k10]\r\n`cached_ranges`: [k1, k3], [k6, k10]\r\nand [k1, k3] and [k6, k10] inherit the safe point from [k1, k10].\r\nFor example, assume [k1, k10] have safe point 10 and ongoing snapshot with read_ts 12 before eviction.\r\nAfter evcition, [k1, k3] and [k6, k10] have inheritent the safe point 10 so that they only accept safe point update with value larger than 10.\r\nHowever, when doing gc among [k1, k3] and [k6, 10], they will not consider the onging snapshot with read_ts 12 of their parent range. So they can update safe point to be larger than 12 even though the snapshot with read_ts is not dropped which compromise the snapshot semantics.",
