Is the leader going to remain in ProgressState::snapshot forever ? \r\n\r\nThe peer state is changed after the snapshot is sent(either finished or failed). It will call the callback and call `report_snapshot_status` with send a `SignificantMsg::SnapshotStatus` to the raftstore, on this message, the region leader will change target peer's state to Replicate.\r\n\r\n> And also i don't see a retry if snapshot send is failed.\r\n\r\nYes, there is no retry here, so if send failed the peer status will change back to replicate. And the snapshot procedure will be trigger after an AppendResponse(triggered by new raft log) or a HeartbeatResponse(if no new message aft 1 tick)."
