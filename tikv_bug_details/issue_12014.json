  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/commit/a7d1595f5486616be34e0cf2bbf372edb5f0e85a\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nThe `sample_num` of `ReadStats` should be updated along with the user config. However, in the current implementation, TiKV uses `ReadStats::default()` to create each `ReadStats` without considering the actual `sample_num` config.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/a7d1595f5486616be34e0cf2bbf372edb5f0e85a/components/raftstore/src/store/worker/split_controller.rs#L397-L404\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/a7d1595f5486616be34e0cf2bbf372edb5f0e85a/src/storage/metrics.rs#L26-L34\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nIf the user adjusts the default config and sets a large `sample_num`, the Load Base Split may not work due to the insufficient number of the sampled key range.\r\n",

One suggestion is that in order to keep everything tidy, you may want to make `SplitConfigManager` static rather than one of its fields and change all of its usages to the static variable."
