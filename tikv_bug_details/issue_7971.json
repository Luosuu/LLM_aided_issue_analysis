  "title": "raftstore: incorrectly batch read index request",
  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/3c667df061265ce46c9f8ec626f949b923047367/components/raftstore/src/store/peer.rs#L2102-L2117\r\n\r\nIn line 2113, we batch some requests into one but it's wrong if we batch `read index` request because we use the same read index to respond all of `read index` response.\r\n\r\nThis may **break** the read index correctness.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n1. a `read index` request 1 gets commit index 10 then heartbeats will be sent to others to check if it is a true leader.\r\n2. An append entry response comes and the commit index forwards to 11.\r\n3. Apply log 11 and respond to the client.\r\n4. A new `read index` request comes and is batched to the previous one.\r\n5. The heartbeats come and respond to clients with these two `read index` requests whose index is 10, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe latter `read index` request comes in step 4 after step 3, but the answer is only 10, not 11.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report!
