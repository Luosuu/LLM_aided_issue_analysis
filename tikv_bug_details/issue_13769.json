  "title": "When the new collation is not enabled, `_` pattern in like misbehaved",
  "body": "The TiKV always uses the charset of the collation to decode and compare strings for `like` function. However, if the new collation is not enabled, the collation information is not pushed down from TiDB to TiKV, and TiKV cannot get the charset information from it.\r\n\r\nThe simple solution is getting the charset information from the original arguments.\r\n\r\nRelated issue: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/32323",
