  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nCurrent master. It looks some of release versions also suffers from this.\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nNot relative.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Start a TiKV cluster.\r\n2. Look at the series `tikv_unified_read_pool_thread_count`.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nThat should be the config value of `readpool.unified.max-thread-count`.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nIt is zero. Until I modify the config with:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nset config tikv `readpool.unified.max-thread-count` = 3;\r\nset config tikv `readpool.unified.max-thread-count` = 4;\r\n```\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2024-03-12 at 12 15 27@2x](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/36239017/b42d817d-2b41-4c7f-8d87-f733bc77474b)\r\n\r\n",
