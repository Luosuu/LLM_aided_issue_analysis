Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nnightly(f1c16b8e9c8fcc4ee908a045fe7e03b887d35489)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\nDoesn't matter\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
