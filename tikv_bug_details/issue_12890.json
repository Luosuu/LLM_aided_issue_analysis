  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n\r\nv6.1.0\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun write workload for a long time, observe the size of encryption key dictionary. The dictionary will grow indefinitely.\r\n\r\nFor a typical write workload, there are thousands of new WAL files generated by Raft Engine per day. The encryption keys associated with these files will not be cleaned up. They will occupy memory and disk space until one of them is full. Afterwards the server cannot be booted again.\r\n\r\nThis bug is not observed on any real cluster yet. Setting the severity to major for now.",
