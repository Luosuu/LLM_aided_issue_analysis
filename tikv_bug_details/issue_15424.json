  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\nrocksdb uses `max_background_flushes` and `max_background_compactions` to control the background thread pool size, see:\r\n \r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/rocksdb/blob/fe76937087f81e95a323bbf00fcd109c7b39c649/db/db_impl/db_impl_compaction_flush.cc#L2582-L2605\r\n\r\nWhile in tikv, we only support set `max_background_jobs` and `max_background_flushes`, and then calculate `max_background_compactions` by `max_background_jobs - max_background_flushes`. But in `DBConfigManager`, `max_background_compactions` is not updated when `max_background_jobs` or `max_background_flushes` changes.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n",
