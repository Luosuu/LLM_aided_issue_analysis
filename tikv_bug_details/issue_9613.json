Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nv5.0.0-rc\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nAutoSplitController always encode key as if it's transaction kv, which is wrong in raw kv.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/80582cb06f845a400090febb5cbaaf05250a2695/components/raftstore/src/store/worker/split_controller.rs#L378-L382\r\n\r\nThis can result in large region that can't be split. I suggest to always treat split key as internal keys just like all other observers/workers do.",
