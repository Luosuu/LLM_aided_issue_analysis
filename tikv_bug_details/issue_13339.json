  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nTiKV reload takes too long. The TiKV log shows it is doing manual compaction (\"compact range finished\").\r\n\r\nNormally, compaction will be cancelled if DB is closed. However, TiKV's `DB` will only be closed when no one is referencing it.\r\n\r\nRelated to #13338 \r\n\r\nPossible solution(s):\r\n- Expose `DB::close` and call it during TiKV shutdown",
