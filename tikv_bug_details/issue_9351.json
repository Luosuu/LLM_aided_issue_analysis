  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nSimilar to #9208, ReadIndex request can be given a stale index after just transferring leader. The API doesn't seem to be used anymore, so the best way to solve it is removing the API completely.\r\n\r\n@NingLin-P @gengliqi PTAL\r\n\r\n/cc @solotzg, just make sure tiflash will not use the API in the future.",
