  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\nEvery peer has a dedicated channel to receive requests and messages. While each channel does have a predefined capacity, the number of peers is not limited. As a result, the cumulative channel buffer effectively becomes limitless, thereby potentially leading to OOM errors. Such issues have been observed in #15061, #13731 and #12983.\r\n\r\nTiKV should have a memory quota for channels, skip or abort sending messages if quota exceeded.\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\nv7.3.0\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\nCreate a cluster with many regions, then pause raftstore threads and run a uniform write workload.\r\n",
