Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n\r\nLatest nightly, after https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/12679\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nLaunch TiKV, with default config (auto-tune is off).\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nThread cpu time should not be collect in critical paths (e.g. `Storage::get` and `Scheduler::process_write`) when we don't set any cpu limit and turn off auto-tune.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nI can observe large portion of time used for getting thread cpu time from the flamegraph, in process write of the txn scheduler.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17217495/179693028-0a33bffd-81c3-4a16-be7f-ac085e189bc8.png)\r\n",
