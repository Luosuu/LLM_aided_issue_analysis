  "title": "TiKV may stuck/panic if a destroy peer message is handled after apply snapshot on raftstore v1",
  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nConsider a learner node is down when a merging takes place. Then a snapshot of merged target peer will arrive after the node restarts, together with a destroy peer message of source peer.\r\n\r\nConsider the apply snapshot is sent and handled before destroy peer, overlap will take place. For Leader, this situation usually do no harm, since a vote request may save us. For Learner, it may stuck if we are using normal mode TiKV, or panic if we are using serverless mode TiKV.\r\n\r\nWe can't just clean the source peer according to region epoch.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n",

      "body": "Yes, it applies to raftstore v1. I don't know if is applies to raftstore v2. It seldomly happens in Voter, since a Voter may actively send RequestVote msg when it fails to find its Leader peer, and eventually it will find the region is tombstoned. I think the severity of this problem may be decreased."
