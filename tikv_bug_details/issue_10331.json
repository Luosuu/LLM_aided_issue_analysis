Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n5.0.2\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nCheck \"TiKV Details - Server - Hibernate Peers\" metrics.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\"hibernated\" and \"awaken\" should both be positive and their sum should be equal to region count, i.e. the `tikv_raftstore_region_count` metric.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nThe hibernate peers metric can be negative and not equal to region count, which is apparently incorrect.\r\n![Lark20210608-211423](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2606959/121292275-89f73680-c89e-11eb-95ef-b9afa17ac998.png)\r\n\r\n",
