  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nmaster\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\nTiKV runs verify-checksum before ingest one sst files. And TiKV executes this operation in apply-thread. If there are a lot of files waiting to be ingested, it will cost a lot of time to calculate checksum for them in only one thread.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n",
