  "title": "Add observability on GRPC server connections",
  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nI would really like to see more observability in TiKV GRPC. I am specifically looking for health metrics https://grpc.io/docs/guides/health-checking/ and grpc status codes metrics. I think it might help us to figure out what type network errors are going on in the system.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n",
