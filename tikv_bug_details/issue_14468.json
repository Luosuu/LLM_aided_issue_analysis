      "body": "This root cause of this issue is that the max size of `raft-engine.prefill-for-recycle` is 12GB by default. This makes the max capacity of prefilled recycled files is 12 GB / 128MB(`target-file-size`) = 96.\r\n\r\nIn this test case, the `purge-threshold` is set to be 200GB (expect at least 200GB / 128MB = 1600 files for making log recycling effective), massively exceeding the expectation of `prefill-for-recycle` function."
