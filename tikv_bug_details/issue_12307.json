      "body": "If the primary DC fails while a region is being scheduled and the operator contains the operation of adding peer to the primary DC node. It is possible that the new peer will be created after the recovery from dr center. That is, this region may not be able to elect a leader afterwards.\r\nTo solve this problem, we need to use online recovery (which is not GA yet). Another temporary solution is to stop the cluster and run tikv-ctl unsafe-recover again."
