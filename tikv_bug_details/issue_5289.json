  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n**What version of TiKV are you using?**\r\nmaster\r\n\r\n**What operating system and CPU are you using?**\r\nAny\r\n\r\n**What did you do?**\r\n\r\nAs is convention in the Rust ecosystem, as I have for the last year and a half, I ran `cargo run --bin tikv-server` to start a TiKV development build of the server.\r\n\r\nThe command reported:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: no bin target named `tikv-server`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe README.md does not describe how to workaround this problem.\r\n\r\nThe target machine does not have access to a copy of `make` that can support the complex Makefile.\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\n\r\nTiKV, as a rust project, to build and operate like a Rust project.\r\n\r\nTiKV, as a repository of tikv project, should follow the conventions of our other rust projects and support a clean `cargo run` behavior.\r\n\r\n**What did you see instead?**\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: no bin target named `tikv-server`\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What action should be taken?\r\n\r\nI suggest reverting https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/5242 or adding documentation to all of our README files, as well as our `/Cargo.toml` documenting this.\r\n\r\nI would prefer reverting https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/5242. I think this has very poor usability for folks trying out contributing or developing TiKV for their first time.",

OTOH, it is *really good* for new contributors if the Cargo workflows work (even if they are not doing the optimal things). Using Cargo is very standard in the Rust community."
