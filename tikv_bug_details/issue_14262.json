  "body": "## Bug Report\r\nin PR #9257, we introduced the suspended time in the tracker. However this information is included in process time in TiDB side, which misleads the investigation. As slow process time typically means low IO or CPU resources. \r\nIt should be exposed as suspended time itself in TiDB. \r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n6.5 Or newer\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\nCheck out the TiDB dashboard and view the slow query's detail information. The process time includes the suspended time. \r\n### What did you expect?\r\nThere should be standalone item called suspended time in TiDB\r\n### What did happened?\r\nThe process time includes the suspended time.
