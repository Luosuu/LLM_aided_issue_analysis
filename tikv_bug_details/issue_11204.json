  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n\r\nStandard linux.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/7306, the memory fragmentation is relaxed by greatly reducing the frequency of reading the thread list.\r\n\r\nHowever, as external storage is calling `block_on_external_io`, which will create new threads each time, the thread list cache trick in #7306 is roughly ineffective, which increases the fragmentation risk.\r\n\r\n> This issue is previously discovered by @sticnarf in https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/11196#issuecomment-955961878. I moved it to a new issue for better focused discussion.",
