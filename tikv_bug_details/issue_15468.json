Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nv7.1.0\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nIrrelative.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nRun reading workload at a cluster with frequently peer moving (but not greater than the store-limit).\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nEverything goes well, expect light performance regression.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nThere are slow queries. Which cost most time on `is_witness` back-offing (which's basic back off duration is `1s`.). \r\n\r\ncc https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/13767, which fixed the panic here, but making TiKV response `IsWitness`.\r\n",
