Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nnightly  commit hash# 6a906dae15f62be7df7c707c43550e25c0599a9a\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\nEnable partitioned-raft-kv and run sysbench insert\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nRegion split will be stable and slow\r\n### What did happened?\r\nRegion split is about 100 per minutes. And many tikv requests failed and grpc latency is very high. \r\n\r\n![Feishu20230302-215556](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9442422/222642698-0343575b-d3c0-466d-a1f7-7084f421a6bd.jpeg)\r\n![Feishu20230302-215547](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9442422/222642699-a26eb939-ebae-4bc1-801d-dc675f228ee0.jpeg)\r\n\r\n",
