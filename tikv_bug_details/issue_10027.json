Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nv4.0.11\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\nnot related\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\nCan't reproduce\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nspace is properly reclaimed\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13497871/114964885-2f46ed00-9ea2-11eb-9c1c-ade04118347e.png)\r\nrocksdb snapshot is held about 1.2 weeks, which causes region worker won't clean up the data of region when the peer is removed.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13497871/114964934-3ff76300-9ea2-11eb-8a2a-68967cbcf618.png)\r\nthere are 8 rocksdb snapshots leaked. And it happens in multiple tikv nodes. There must be something wrong that the rocksdb snapshot release is not properly called or some threads got stuck.\r\n",
