Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n6.2.0\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nK8S\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Run workload \r\n2. Start log backup task \r\n3. run tikv network partition chaos 20 minutes every 50 minutes\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nLog backup checkpoint should move forward when chaos is restored\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n![origin_img_v2_617d52a6-ac84-4b5c-bb85-8f930549599g](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7403864/180954542-ce708876-3da9-4338-8940-f1d11ef881b8.jpg)\r\n![origin_img_v2_617d52a6-ac84-4b5c-bb85-8f930549599g](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7403864/180954564-f950bd23-bde0-4446-afa8-f69a00097cfb.jpg)\r\n![origin_img_v2_4210aa87-9727-438a-b240-b1dad11b652g](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7403864/180954592-48374384-681a-41e6-b2f1-2e763e2cc167.jpg)\r\n\r\n",

However raftstore would reject the initial scanning request when `PrepareMerge` applied but `CommitMerge` not applied, it simply replies `ReadIndexNotReady`. "
