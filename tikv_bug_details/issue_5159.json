  "title": "How does 5 tikv nodes handle two nodes fault?",
  "body": "## Question\r\nIn [FAQ](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/wiki/TiKV-FAQ#can-raft--multiple-replicas-in-the-tikv-architecture-achieve-absolute-data-security-is-it-necessary-to-apply-the-most-strict-mode-sync-log--true-to-a-standalone-storage), it says that a cluster of 5 tikv nodes can tolerate two nodes fault. I don't fully understand how does it work? I mean as raft requires >50% nodes return ACK, with a replica equals to 3, even two nodes down in 5 nodes cluster may cause some regions that are left only one copy. In this case, how could raft receives >50% ACK?\r\n\r\nOr do I misunderstand this FAQ, it actually says 5 nodes with a replica equals to 5?\r\n",
