  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nSuppose region 1 [a, c) is split into region 2 [a, b) and region 1 [b, c). If learner is isolated before split for quite a long time that leader has been hibernated. After the learner rejoin the group, it may catch up logs by snapshot. So new replica for region 2 will not be created on the node. And because leader of region 2 is hibernated, so it will not be woken up until a long time. In this case learner for the region 2 will be missing for quite a long time, hence lead to unavailable.",
