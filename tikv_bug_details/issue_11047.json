  "title": "Channel full could break the raft connection",
  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nInside the implementation of the `raft` and `batch_raft`:\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/6d0edd7e690d376e651aecf6f0bbefdeec22c390/src/server/service/kv.rs#L697-L709\r\n\r\nIf L705 returns error `RaftStoreError::Transport(DiscardReason::Full)`, the `res` future will resolve to that error immediately and the `RequestStream` will be dropped hence the RPC stream is broken.\r\n\r\nBreaking the raft connection when the channel full occur doesn't help much about the situation and even bring more problems instead:\r\n- Raft messages that have been received but not process yet will be dropped silently\r\n- Breaking the connection could also cause hibernated followers to wake up to start a new election, and potentially could cause region unavailable due to split vote (usually happen when there are more than 3 voters)\r\n",
