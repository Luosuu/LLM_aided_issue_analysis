  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n\r\nmaster (5.0.0-rc.x, 2d3c66cc44ea19a4e339ec44cf1fcd1477555b7d)\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n\r\nCentOS 7.6.1810\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n(I'm currently not sure if it can be reproduced)\r\n\r\nConstruct a case where a lot of region scheduling or adding peer. For example:\r\n\r\n1. Prepare a cluster with at least 4 TiKV nodes and load a lot of data to generate 10K+ regions. Enable hibernate region.\r\n2. Stop all read and write, and then all regions should be cold.\r\n3. Stop one of the nodes, and offline it with PD\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nThe regions that has a missing peer should quickly add a new peer, limited by PD's configurations like region-schedule-limit, max-snapshot-count and store limit.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nIt's slow. PD's metrics shows that AddLearner operator runs slowly. After disabling hibernate region, it becomes faster.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9948422/108591818-91550b80-73a5-11eb-874f-2b502624be9f.png)\r\n\r\n",
