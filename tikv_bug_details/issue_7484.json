  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n\r\n4.0-beta.2 and up\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n\r\nUnrelated\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Start a transaction, run a big query (for example `SELECT COUNT(*)` from a big table).\r\n2. Start some other big queries.\r\n3. While those big queries are in process, run a small query (for example a point select) in the transaction started in 1.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nThe small query finishes quickly.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nBecause we use start_ts as the task id, the priority of the small query is lowered by the previously executed big query, thus it may take some time to finish. I don't think it's a reasonable strategy.",
