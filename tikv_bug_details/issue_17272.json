  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\nv7.2 includes a rust-rocksdb commit (https://github.com/tikv/rust-rocksdb/pull/740) that unexpectedly changes the bloom filter name, invalidating bloom filters built by TiKV versions <=v7.1.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/rust-rocksdb/blob/224bed6ffa29ba3bbe9a91ef6bda7186200c59a8/librocksdb_sys/crocksdb/c.cc#L3930-L3944\r\n\r\nThis occurs because filter names are written in SST files, and RocksDB only uses filters included in SST files with matching names.\r\n\r\n~To workaround this issue, TiKV needs to add two filters during RocksDB Instantiation, one with the original name, and the other with the new name:~\r\n* ~Original: rocksdb.BuiltinBloomFilter~\r\n* ~New: rocksdb.BuiltinBloomFilter.FullBloom~\r\n\r\n(Edit: I made a false assumption, RocksDB can only accept one filter.)\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\n\\>=v7.2\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\nUpgrade and check if the filter insert metrics in TiKV rocksdb block cache metrics.\r\nIt should be similar to the picture in https://github.com/tikv/rust-rocksdb/pull/740#issuecomment-1498394224\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nBloom filters are still valid.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nBloom filters are invalidated.",
