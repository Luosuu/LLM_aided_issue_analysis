  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/fa74aef163541d8e9795b468cad1a0592f839b1a/components/region_cache_memory_engine/src/background.rs#L239-L246\r\n\r\nIn above code, in-memory engine obtains a safe_point from a local clock which may suffer from clock drift.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/fa74aef163541d8e9795b468cad1a0592f839b1a/components/region_cache_memory_engine/src/range_manager.rs#L241-L243\r\n\r\nThe safe_point is used to check if a cache is eligible to serve a read request. If the safe_point drifts into the future, for example by 10 minutes, the cache will not be able to serve any requests for those 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n\r\nNightly, 2024-06-10\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\nNo need.\r\n",
