  "body": "## Bug Report\r\nIn TiKV, the annotation to the func `ingest_external_file_optimized` shows that the return `true` means the `INGEST` has been done without blocking.\r\n![image](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/18441614/fd91cf79-a3c6-4436-b4df-4fc8acc6bdc1)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, according to the implementation, it shows that the `has_flush` will be set to `true` if the current `INGEST` is a blocking flush.\r\n![image](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/18441614/f99ce6a4-d0ce-4856-9bbb-5a29f44844fa)\r\n\r\nAnd the annotation of `ingest_external_file_optimized` is contradict with the implementation, which has mislead the metrics of `INGEST SST duration seconds`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report!
