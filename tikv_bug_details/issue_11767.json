      "body": "From the log we can ensure that the region with minimal resolved ts is an orphan follower:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20279863/148382580-b7b43c90-16d7-421c-9cff-1766ad785822.png)\r\n\r\nIn general, the resolved ts of a follower should be synced from its leader. But in this case, the orphan follower cannot get resolved ts from any other peer, so this phenomenon is expected.\r\n\r\nThis issue exports a problem that we can not simply distinguish whether the resolved ts could not be advanced or just could not receive from leaders. This PR #11809 added more metrics to fix this problem."
