Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\nAs title, because it mistakenly includes task wait time in the scheduler worker pool.\r\nAs a result, the metric is higher than the actual value, particularly when TiKV is under load.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/ff78c79606a24610f96cd5b01a9d5268795027d1/src/server/raftkv/mod.rs#L585-L601\r\n\r\nI believe this change is made by  accident because it is introduced in a refactor PR https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/13854 .\r\n\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\nv7.5.2\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\nRun go-yscb 100% update with 1000 threads.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nDo not include task wait time in the scheduler worker pool.\r\n",
