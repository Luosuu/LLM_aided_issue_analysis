      "body": "Notice to correct:\r\nIt's a corner issue triggered by deploying tikv based on the self-defined `rocky-8.9` image. And it's hard to fully support it by an elegant way.\r\nSo, just left it as a tracking issue if anyone encounters the same problems later. And to workaround it, users can directly set the configuration `memory-usage-limit` with the expected value."
