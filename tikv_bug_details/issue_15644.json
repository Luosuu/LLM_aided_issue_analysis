Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter commit merge, the merged_records of target merge will never be cleaned up,\r\nbecause followers never report GcPeerResponse if they finish commit merge\r\nnormally.\r\nTiKV must reports GcPeerResponse for merged source peers in `on_gc_peer_request`.\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/ec4a9002f153f86c609e902ba685eee7a1224e6c/components/raftstore-v2/src/operation/life.rs#L647-L665\r\n\r\nThis issue may bloat `RegionLocalState`.\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\nv7.3.0\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\nMerge two regions.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nmerged_records are cleaned up eventually.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nAs title.",
