      "body": "from @MyonKeminta \r\nalmost full nodes (all followers but no leader) refuse to apply new logs from the leader. As a result, the region epoch is not updated when it changes. As a follower reads, the follower receives read requests with new epochs. As a result, the epoch does not match\r\n\r\nBecause the node is full, there is a mechanism to prevent the raft log from continuing to chase. If the epoch change is included in the log, subsequent follower read requests received by the node will report that the epoch not match fails. The improvement here should be that followers read requests to avoid sending them to nodes marked full or almost full"
