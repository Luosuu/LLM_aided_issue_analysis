Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nv5.0.2\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nDoesn't matter.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nPut a lot of keys and then delete most of them using RawKV API\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nThe size of instance decrease at some point.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nThe size is still larger than expect.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/master/components/raftstore/src/store/worker/compact.rs#L207\r\n\r\nTiKV only checks tombstone for write cf. But RawKV only uses default CF, so no manual compaction is triggered at all even if there are a lot of tombstone.",
