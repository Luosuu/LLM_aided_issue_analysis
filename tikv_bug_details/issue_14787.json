Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\nAs title, it's quite expensive to generate a snapshot.\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\nRun `test_new_split_learner_can_not_find_leader`.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nDo not generate snapshot for slow split.  \r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nA snapshot is generated.\r\n",
