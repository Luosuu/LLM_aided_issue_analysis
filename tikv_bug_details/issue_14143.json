Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n\r\nv6.5.0\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n\r\nDoesn't matter.\r\n\r\n### What happened?\r\n\r\nThe client like TiDB will handle `FlashbackNotPrepared` as a sign that the flashback has been finished for this region and keep retrying the flashback if any other error occurs until success. However, the current implementation will directly return a `TxnLockNotFound` error in the case the flashback request is received without preparing first, which will cause TiDB client to keep retrying to send the flashback request to a region that has finished the flashback.",
