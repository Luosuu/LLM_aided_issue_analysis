  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n3.0.10\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nLinux, CPU doesn't matter.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nStarts a cluster with many TiKV instances (>=8), and keep running in a high workload, with many short living regions.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nMemory usage keeps in a steady level.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nMemory keeps rising until OOM.\r\n\r\nRouter uses channel, which won't free memory buffer until all its senders and receivers are dropped. Receivers are dropped right after FSMs are dropped. But senders in cache will be dropped very slowly and lead to OOM eventually.\r\n\r\nI have submitted a patch to crossbeam to release memory when all receivers are dropped to resolve the problem. TiKV needs to upgrade crossbeam-channel to 0.5.1 to land the patch.",
