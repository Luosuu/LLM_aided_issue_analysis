  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe current implementation of batch get request cross command has a bug that may cause raw get produce incorrect result. The raw `PointGetCommand` is created via `from_raw_get` method, which [encodes the key](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/5598/files#diff-a2828e4f71806f3e4623d048057803d4R134), however for raw kv the key shouldn't be encoded. And in the unit test's code [here](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/5598/files#diff-a2828e4f71806f3e4623d048057803d4R3391), it didn't use `from_raw_get` to create the request, so the mistake is not dicovered by unit tests.\r\n",
