  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nMaster.\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nFor a given subscriped region, after emiting an `EventError` to one downstream, the downstream may still have an unfinished incremental scan, and the scan will still emit some events to the downstream.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't be allowed. It\r\n\r\n* can cause ticdc panic on \"an committed entry with CommitTs less than ResolvedTs\";\r\n* may cause https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/11343.\r\n",
