Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\nTiKV\r\nRelease Version:   4.1.0-alpha\r\nGit Commit Hash:   f2e7a835f61734409c5174a208164348b7326d6d\r\nGit Commit Branch: master\r\nRust Version:      rustc 1.42.0-nightly (0de96d37f 2019-12-19)\r\nEnable Features:   jemalloc portable sse protobuf-codec\r\nProfile:           release\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\nUnable to start\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\n* User `foo` starts tikv at <ADDRESS 1>\r\n* User `bar` starts tikv at <ADDRESS 2>\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nAll started successfully.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nUser `bar` cannot start tikv.\r\n\r\n**Reason**: Running tikv will create a new lock under `/tmp/TIKV_LOCK_FILES/` to prevent starting multiple tikv at the same address. However, the folder permissions are owned by user `foo` at this time, and `bar` has no permissions.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# ll -a TIKV_LOCK_FILES\r\ndrwxr-xr-x     2 foo  foo     4096 Apr 14 19:03 .\r\ndrwxrwxrwt. 6927 root root 1298432 Apr 15 08:02 ..\r\n-rw-r--r--     1 foo  foo        0 Apr 14 19:03 0.0.0.0_38820\r\n```",
