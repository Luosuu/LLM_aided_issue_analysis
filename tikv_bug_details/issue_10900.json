A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\nPause TiCDC process, eg., `kill -SIGSTOP <CDC_PID>` .\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nSnapshots should be released within a specified time period., eg 10mins. \r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nSnapshots may be hold arbitrary long.

Like, add a timeout for holding snapshot?\r\n\r\nA timeout should be good enough for most cases.\r\n\r\nAlso, we need to consider another variant of this case: a TiCDC straggler, flow control can always make progress, but extremely slow. It may hold snapshot for a long time too."
