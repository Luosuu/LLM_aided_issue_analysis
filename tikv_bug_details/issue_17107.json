  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\nWhen `check_leader` of resovled_ts is called on a unreachable (e.g. stopped) TiKV node, it might take too long time to fail, and may introduce lags to resolved_ts. [This PR](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/16943) tries to limit the timeout of `check_leader` with the configuration `advance-ts-interval`, but it didn't cover CDC and log-backup. So when CDC is used, even with `advance-ts-interval` set to a very small value, it can still be observed that resolved-ts lags for too long time during TiKV upgrading.\r\n\r\nRef: https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/16698\r\n",
