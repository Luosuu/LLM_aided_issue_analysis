Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nv7.5.1\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\nI was running a test cluster in tidb cloud, and 2 pd instance is down due to some env issues. Then I found all 3 tikv cpu are about 150% will there is no workload.\r\nFrom the metrics I see pd-worker's cpu is about 100% and timer's cpu is about 50%.\r\n<img width=\"681\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/5196885/f03bb9d3-40d7-427c-a2a9-9fdd38627703\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"676\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/5196885/e28d61ec-9368-4fc9-bc9f-757399ba882f\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n",
