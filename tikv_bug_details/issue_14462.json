  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\nIn some heavy read-write workload,  Raft-Engine's rewrite load has strong correlation with grpc qps jitter. \r\nThough increasing the raft-engine gc threshold could mitigate it,  we may need a better default value as a short term mitigation. \r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nv7.0\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"913\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-23 at 8 20 03 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9442422/227833664-30996968-702c-49b1-8260-6d190989d1d4.png\">\r\n",
