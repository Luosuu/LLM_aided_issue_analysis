  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n4.0, master\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nRun TiKV with `security.redact-info-log = true`, still seeing user keys being printed in hex form in info log. example:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"842\" alt=\"WeChatWorkScreenshot_e00b32ca-0c42-407b-86a4-2511118488d9\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2606959/102050509-db16e980-3d97-11eb-8145-2afc3f3d6997.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nall info logs should be redact. We'd better add a CI to prevent misuse of `hex::encode_upper` or `hex::encode_lower` to print keys into debug log.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nsome info logs are not redacted",
