      "body": "This error is due to the copr resp size exceeds 4GB.  https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/9012\r\n\r\nIt's confirmed as the chunk codec(arrow codec) would reserve space for the fixed-length field even if the value is null. So when there are lots of fixed-length fields filling with null, the size of copr resp would be amplified by multiple times and exceed 4GB."
