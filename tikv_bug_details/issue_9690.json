  "title": "pd connection is reconnecting every 10 minutes",
  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n#7028 adds a new behavior that reconnecting PD leader every 10 minutes. The motivation is avoiding unavailability during pd member changes without restarting TiKV. However, the implementation reconnecting PD unconditionally, which can drop all pd region heartbeats every 10 minutes. If hibernate region is enabled, it can make scheduler ops from PD working very slowly.\r\n\r\nPD doesn't need to be reconnected if memberships are the same.\r\n\r\nPerhaps related to #9681.\r\n",
