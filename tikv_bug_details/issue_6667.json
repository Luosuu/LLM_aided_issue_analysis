  "body": "## Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe:\r\n<!-- A description of what the problem is. -->\r\nAfter enable `hibernate regions`, the leader may go into `Idle` State. If a region splits during a node is down, after that node restarts, the newly created region will not be created on the node until the leader is awakened.\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you'd like:\r\n<!-- A description of what you want to happen. -->\r\nIt may hurt the performance of replica read. We could add an **option** for broadcasting `MsgWakeUp` after a node is restarted.\r\n\r\n",
