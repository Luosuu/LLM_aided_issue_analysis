      "body": "Ultimately, this situation can only be avoided by constraining leader write flow when follower apply is lagging.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, we can do two things to alleviate the impact of this issue:\r\n- Rewrite Raft Groups that consistently lags behind others: https://github.com/tikv/raft-engine/pull/193\r\n- Improve the read performance of Raft Engine: https://github.com/tikv/raft-engine/pull/194\r\n\r\nWorkaround: https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/12011#issuecomment-1049477349"
