  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n5.1.2\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\nI have add some metrics in TiKV in PR: https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/11377/files\r\nAnd we find that TiKV was busy with write the deleted keys to RaftDB. Because most of GC Batch is small but the number of regions which need to clean is large.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16376959/142194352-18790a91-8b33-492b-8901-b93a46070186.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nI hope TiKV can consume the GC task as soon as possible,\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nThere are more and more data in RaftDB.  I got thousands  of SST files in RaftDB and it usually was small (maybe tens).\r\n",
