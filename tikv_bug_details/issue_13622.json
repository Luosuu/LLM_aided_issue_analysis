Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n/ # /tikv-server -V\r\nTiKV\r\nRelease Version: 6.2.0-alpha\r\nEdition: Community\r\nGit Commit Hash: https://github.com/tikv/tikv/commit/8b915d3b4894c01c843f452ae5a6a579e4b4b208\r\nGit Commit Branch: heads/refs/tags/v6.3.0\r\nUTC Build Time: 2022-09-22 07:38:02\r\nRust Version: rustc 1.64.0-nightly (0f4bcadb4 2022-07-30)\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nK8s \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Deploy cluster with 6 TiKV in Azure, each AZ has 2 TiKV, isolation-level configured to by \"zone\"\r\n2. Start log backup task\r\n3. Inject single AZ failure (injects failure to PD/TiDB/TiKV in a single AZ)\r\n4. Check log backup checkpoint lag\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nWhen single AZ disaster happens, TiDB can still provide services though it might be downgraded.  PITR checkpoint lag should still be less than 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nFrom our testing, QPS dropped from 30k to 8.82k, and then stabilized at 13k within 1 minute\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7403864/196170886-1d14b100-7454-404b-afc1-c7f45aa16846.png)\r\n\r\nDuring az down fault, checkpoint delay may exceed 5 minutes \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7403864/196171167-2b5597fd-6883-4b59-9195-9f93a8e466e2.png)\r\n\r\n22:02 error recover， checkpoint lag could still be > 5 min within 5 minutes after recovery.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7403864/196171526-0c100b6d-f8f8-4bec-92ca-883b0b153c79.png)\r\n\r\nAfter 5 minutes of fault recovery, the checkpoint flag drops to less than 5 minutes, about 3-4 minutes：\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7403864/196171830-acdccf5b-bd4b-4617-ad1e-4da5e742b6a6.png)\r\n\r\n",
