  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\nBoth Lightning import and BR restore will read ingest data for checksum verification. However, TiKV currently does not load SST files immediately after ingestion. This delay causes checksum mismatches, leading to failures in Lightning and BR.\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\nNightly, 2024-06-23\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\nJust run BR restore.\r\n",
