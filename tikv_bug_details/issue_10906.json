  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n\r\nNot really related. It affects at least TiKV 4.0 ~ 5.2.\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n\r\nI can confirm the problem on Linux x86-64 and Linux aarch64.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun `make dist_release`. And use `dwz` on the binary, it reports:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ objcopy --decompress-debug-sections bin/tikv-server\r\n$ dwz bin/tikv-server\r\ndwz: bin/tikv-server: Couldn't find DIE at [d4bb7] referenced by DW_AT_abstract_origin from DIE at [17c2a3]\r\n```\r\n\r\n[dwarf-validate](https://github.com/gimli-rs/gimli/blob/master/examples/dwarf-validate.rs) also reports dwarf errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDWARF error in bin/tikv-server: Invalid intra-unit reference in unit 0xb4181 from DIE 0xc8122 to 0x20a36\r\nDWARF error in bin/tikv-server: Invalid intra-unit reference in unit 0xb4181 from DIE 0xc813f to 0x208ea\r\nDWARF error in bin/tikv-server: Invalid intra-unit reference in unit 0xb4181 from DIE 0xc8156 to 0x208c0\r\nDWARF error in bin/tikv-server: Invalid intra-unit reference in unit 0xb4181 from DIE 0xc81b9 to 0x59c\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nThere should not be dwarf errors.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nDwarf tools report errors.",

The dwarf errors disappear if only using thin LTO.\r\n\r\nSome upstream bug reports:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66118\r\n\r\nMalformed dwarf information may cause some trouble to debuggers. GDB sometimes gets stuck or crashes when it encounters these incorrect dwarf info."
