  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nv6.5.1\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nNot sure, but probably irrelative.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n(Not checked, but this did be observed in a production cluster.)\r\n1. Create a table with small raws(perhaps with a sole column of primary key), let it be `t1`.\r\n2. Create a table with larger raws(perhaps with a huge `blob` or `json` column), let it be `t2`.\r\n3. Open a changefeed which observes both `t1` and `t2`.\r\n4. Update as many different rows as possible in `t1`.\r\n5. Update as many different rows as possible in `t2`, until the memory usage of old value doesn't increase any more.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nAfter step 5, the memory usage of old value cache should be kept under the memory quota.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n![f0dfe499-6db5-4c5d-b612-989d3dcbb821](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/36239017/8a235f82-298f-4262-b336-d19e8e94285e)\r\n\r\nThe old-value cache usage exceeds the quota.\r\n",
