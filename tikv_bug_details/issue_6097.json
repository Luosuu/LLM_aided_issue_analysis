      "body": "I'm investigating. I can reproduce the error and it is certainly introduced by #5379, in particular by separating out the `tests` crate (which was done to work around another Cargo bug with features :-| ).\r\n\r\nMinimal repro I'm using is `cargo test --no-default-features --features=\"failpoints\" -p tests --test failpoints`. The issue seems to be that the feature is not passed to the failpoints test. Not sure why yet.\r\n\r\n(Given that issue, the failpoints test being skipped when not mentioned explicitly is expected)."
