  "title": "TiKV tzdata out of date and may cause correctness issues",
  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\nTiKV bundles tzdata in its binary. We need to upgrade chrono-tz regularly, because tzdata out of date may cause correctness issues, e.g., https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/49586\r\n\r\nIn addition to upgrading chrono-tz,, we should reconsider alternative timezone libraries that read system tzdata directly. This would ensure that TiKV uses the latest tzdata available to the system. Maybe https://crates.io/crates/tzfile?\r\n\r\nCc #4553\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\nAll TiKV version.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/49586\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nTiKV uses the correct timezone info.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nTiKV uses stale timezone info.\r\n",
