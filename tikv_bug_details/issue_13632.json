  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nv6.3.0\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nk8s\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Start log backup tasks\r\n2. Run workloads\r\n3. Inject network partition between one TiKV and one TiDB, the TiDB is PITR checkpoint advance owner.\r\n4. Check PITR checkpoint status\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nDuring one TiKV and one TiDB network partition, TiDB cluster can still provide services (though downgraded).\r\nPITR checkpoint should move forward normally in this case to meet RPO.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nPITR checkpoint doesn't move forward in this case.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7403864/196391474-dac45670-47ed-490a-be2b-f6e9fa18cd11.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7403864/196391506-808341b2-92af-4a73-9475-3266543be955.png)\r\n",
