  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nmaster\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n1. build a backup request with subranges.\r\n2. when the first `batch_size`(8 by default) regions do not intersect with the subranges. this backup task stopped immediately. \r\n```\r\nFor checkpoint backup. it might enter `fineGrainedBackup`.\r\nFor new feature rely on this interface. will receive `EOF` and try backup again.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough the backup client can ensure data integrity and correctness, this may result in some performance regression. Therefore, it is necessary to address this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nall backup subranges should be handled in one backup task.\r\n### What did happened?\r\nthe backup task on this store will exits immediately.\r\n",
