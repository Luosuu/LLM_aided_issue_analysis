Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nnightly\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nDuring the initialization of TiKV, it will check pd connection in `validate_endpoints` with following steps:\r\n1. call `get_members` for all pd endpoints\r\n2. Use the leader information in the first `GetMembersResponse` to connect leader\r\n\r\nBy default, the retry time is unlimited. Sometimes the response may not contain the `leader` field, then TiKV will be hung with the failure to connect leader.\r\n",
