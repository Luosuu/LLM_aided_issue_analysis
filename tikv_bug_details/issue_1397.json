  "body": "I use etcd [local-test](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/tree/master/tools/local-tester) and find that the bank transfer test will fail when enable send/receive corruption flag. \r\n\r\nWhen these flags enabled, local-test will randomly change a byte in the data, but now we have no way to check it.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should wait gRPC, but seem that we still need checksum? /cc @xiang90 ",
