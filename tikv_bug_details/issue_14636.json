  "body": "## Development Task\r\n\r\nThis is part of fixing of https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/42937 . \r\n\r\nIt's quite triky to make it works well with both new clients and old clients that doesn't support this behavior. To simplify the problem, a field `verify_is_primary` can be added to `CheckTxnStatusRequest`, and TiKV only do this check when this field is set to true.\r\n",
