  "title": "Consider choosing block strategy for slog-async",
  "body": "## Question\r\n\r\nThere are lot of `slog-async: logger dropped messages due to channel overflow, count: 7` in tikv's log file. The `count: 7` means 7 logs have been drop due to slogger channel full. There is no way to recover dropped logs, which is not helpful for debugging. The behaviour is controlled by `slog_async::OverflowStrategy`. Instead of `OverflowStrategy::DropAndReport`(current strategy), please consider choosing `OverflowStrategy::Block`, so tikv prints all logs.  \r\n",
