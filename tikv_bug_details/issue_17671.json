  "title": "build: CI tasks are failed on testing loading coprocessor plugins.",
  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nIntroduced by #17466, which has cleared the dependency on `example_coprocessor_plugin`. And it will cause TiKV failed on related UTs, such as `registry_load_and_get_plugin`, as the testing lib is not built when building.\r\n![img_v3_02fo_6fe71872-f120-4c3f-80e9-e09a31bd22ag](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1c432ec-8c74-4881-aee7-0892ccabe722)\r\n\r\nAnd as we can see, the related plugin lib is not built:\r\n![img_v3_02fo_6fe71872-f120-4c3f-80e9-e09a31bd22ag](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e349f8df-631e-4d63-b31b-6f9b989cb71e)\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report!
