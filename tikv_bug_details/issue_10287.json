  "title": "Backup should not recycle threads since we set thread number via config",
  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nBackup threads are recycled when there is no backup task in the past 30 minutes, it becomes unnecessary since https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/8193 sets threads number via config. Keeping a fixed-size threads pool is very cheap.\r\n\r\nAnd for v4.0.x tikv, it leaks threads because we do not shutdown thread pools properly.\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\n~~v4.0.0-v4.0.13~~\r\nv4.0.0-v4.0.9\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/commit/1bdc5ffef8b8bb308ff3be69643a0d0c89aabc23 fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\nRun backup.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nDo not recycle or spawn new threads.\r\n",
