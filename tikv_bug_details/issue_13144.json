Deploy two tikv clusters, up and downstream, up is with tikv-cdc node\r\n2. Preload some data, for example 5 million ycsb workloada rawkv mode.\r\n3. Start ycsb wordloada with rawkv mode.\r\n4. Create tikv-cdc changefeed.\r\n5. Wait 5 minutes and stop ycsb workload\r\n6. Wait cdc sink finish and compare checksum of two  tikv cluster.\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nRaw checksum is the same.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n1.
