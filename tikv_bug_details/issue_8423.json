  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nCPU quota should not return 0.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/226139e82d22cc27bfb6fe65c383d68d9a26fd8a/components/tikv_util/src/sys/cgroup.rs#L256-L270\r\n\r\nThe above calculation can return 0 because cpu limit can be set to arbitrary float that is even less then 1.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/226139e82d22cc27bfb6fe65c383d68d9a26fd8a/components/tikv_util/src/sys/mod.rs#L24-L32\r\n\r\nSo the above code can also return 0, which can cause problems as we have assumed the CPU count is not less than 1.\r\n\r\nA quick fix is returning 1 when cgroup limit is less than 1.\r\n\r\n/cc @sticnarf ",
