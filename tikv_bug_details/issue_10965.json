Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### Affected versions\r\nv5.1, v5.2, master\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nFor Advancing the Resolved TS, we need to verify the leadership of Raft Leaders by calling a `check_leader` RPC every __1s__ to all the other TiKVs (Here we did not filter out learners so there will call the RPC to TiFlash).\r\nHowever, [here](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/master/components/resolved_ts/src/advance.rs#L216) we use `futures::join_all` to wait for all responses to get received. Then once one TiKV got stuck and the timeout is too long, some coroutines would be accumulated and probably lead to OOM.",
