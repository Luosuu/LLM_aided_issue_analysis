      "body": "The root cause of this issue is that the peers enter into `PreChaos` state and ignore the `WakeUp` messages triggered by PD, making the duration of re-voting longer than expected.\r\nAnd it's triggered as follows: \r\n1. Firstly, as the `Hiberate Region` feature is enabled, peers enter `GroupState::Idle` as expected.\r\n2. Secondly, this cluster gets IO hang errors. The QPS is dropped to nearly ZERO (no new WRITE / READ flows to each TiKV node). And it triggers awaken hibernated regions mechanism by sending WakeUp messages to these peers to make them revoting into a short term.\r\n3. However, the `on_check_peer_stale_state_tick` (tick period is 5 minutes by default) goes just right before the raftstore handling the `WakUp` messages, and it makes the state into PreChaos state.\r\n4. Then, the WakeUp messages are ignored as the prerequisite `self.fsm.hibernate_state.group_state() == GroupState::Idle` is invalid.\r\n5. Finally, these peers keep wait for another `on_check_peer_stale_state_tick` to make `PreChaos` into `Chaos` to trigger the re-voting progress. And this makes the recovery duration longer than expected."
