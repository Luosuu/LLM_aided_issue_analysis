      "body": "In this case, does the back-up site have two learners for each region?\r\n If that's the case, it would be blocked by today's check as we likely run into 3 healthy peers and 3 unhealthy peers. And if the remove peer happens on the healthy peer, it would be blocked. \r\nThe argument here is that if the unhealthy peer is learner, then it should not be counted. Then we will have only 3 healthy peers plus one unhealthy learner.  By demoting a healthy peer, we will still have 2 healthy voter which can achieve majority. "
