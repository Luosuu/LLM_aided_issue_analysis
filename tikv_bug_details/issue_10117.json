  "title": "CDC scan tasks interferes between changefeeds",
  "body": "## Development Task\r\n\r\nScan tasks are need in the following scenarios:\r\n1. Initial changefeed setup needs scan history changes.\r\n2. Region split/merge and leader transfer cause eventfeed RPC reconnection, it also needs scan history changes.\r\n\r\nTasks in 1 may need to scan a large amount of data that take a lot of time and block tasks in 2. This results in normal changefeed are blocked by new changefeeds, as graphs below.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2150711/117243087-17430780-ae69-11eb-85df-ae4506756d5f.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2150711/117243578-18286900-ae6a-11eb-8125-033dbb742d0d.png)\r\n\r\nThe green changefeed's checkpoint lag increases after the yellow changefeed is created.\r\n\r\nMetrics export: https://gist.github.com/overvenus/8869d130eb2352407bf5ae444d614ce5\r\n",
