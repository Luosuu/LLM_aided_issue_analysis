      "body": "After some investigation with debug log, the root cause is that `tikv-server` recieves `raw_put` request before becoming leader and no term info is provided in `raw_put` request. Then `raw_put` interface [get the causal ts](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/f55c26368194c9fa595f78e06a67efee60e462a5/src/storage/mod.rs#L1921) from `CausalTsProvider` and encode it to key. However the ts violate  the causality as CausalTsProvider should [flush](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/f55c26368194c9fa595f78e06a67efee60e462a5/components/causal_ts/src/observer.rs#L69-L82) before become leader. When it enter raft process, the node become leader and finish this request. So a key/value pair with wrong ts is writen to tikv with success.\r\n\r\n[debug log.txt](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/files/9612360/debug.log.txt)\r\n"
