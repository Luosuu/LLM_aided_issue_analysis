  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n7.3.0 and 7.4.0\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n1. deploy clusters with both v7.3.0 and v7.4.0 versions (3 tidb + 3 tikv + 1 pd)\r\n2. cluster configs:\r\n```\r\nTidbConfig:{\"mem-quota-query\":1073741824,\"new_collations_enabled_on_first_bootstrap\":false,\"prepared-plan-cache\":{\"enabled\":true}}; \r\nTikvConfig:{\"coprocessor\":{\"region-max-size\":\"1.5GB\",\"region-split-size\":\"1GB\"},\"import.num-threads\":64,\"storage\":{\"engine\":\"partitioned-raft-kv\"},\"storage.block-cache.capacity\":\"30GB\"}\"\r\n```\r\n3. run ycsb workloade\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nNo performance regression\r\n### What did happened?\r\nWith https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/15678, the default write_buffer_size and write_buffer_limit for lockcf was increased to fix the performance regression in write-heavy workload. However, it significantly impacts the performance of workloads with insert/update + scan operations like ycsb-workloade.\r\n",
