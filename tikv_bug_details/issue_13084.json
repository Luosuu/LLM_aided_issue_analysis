Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nmaster\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\nany\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\nThe repro is quite simple:\r\nEnable cpu quota limit for foreground requests, background requests like auto analyze will spend the overhead to collection cpu time usage and vice verse. Which is improper and brings overhead.\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nNo such contamination.\r\n### What did happened?\r\nContamination occurred.\r\n",
