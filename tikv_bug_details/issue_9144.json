  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nrelease-4.0\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\n\r\nBR will read all data of a region and fill it in a SST writer. But it is in-memory, see: https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/master/components/backup/src/writer.rs#L138.\r\nSo if there is a huge region, TiKV may crash for OOM because of keeping all data of this region in memory.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\n- TiKV crashed because of OOM.\r\n",
