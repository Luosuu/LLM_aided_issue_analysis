Our test may create many threads and the `cargo test` will run many tests (maybe depending on the CPU number) at the same time in parallel, which may cause this problem. \r\n\r\nI use `export RUST_TEST_THREADS=4` and the tests pass. \r\n\r\nSo maybe we should:\r\n\r\n1. Use fewer test threads \r\n2. Or adjust the thread number in tests \r\n\r\n",

According to my test, the initial tikv opens `187` fds. after I start/stop a tidb, the fd numbers of tikv is `187` -> `190` -> `193` -> `196` -> `199` -> `200` -> `201` -> `202` ...\r\nSo there must be something unreleased after the gRPC connection to tidb is closed."
