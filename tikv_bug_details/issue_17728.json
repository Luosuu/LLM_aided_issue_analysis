Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\nref #17459\r\n\r\nBy the definition of resolved-ts, we require:\r\n `commit_ts > resolved_ts`, if the commit happens after the calculation of the resolved-ts.\r\n\r\nOur implementation uses min_commit_ts to calculate resolved-ts, so that what we have is: \r\n`commit_ts >= min_commit_ts >= resolved_ts`\r\n\r\n`resolved_ts` may be equal to `commit_ts`, which breaks the definition of resolved-ts.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: This bug **cannot happen in current(v8.4) implementation**. \r\n- Only Pipelined DMLs use min_commit_ts for resolved-ts calculation\r\n- These min_commit_ts used are (indirectly) from PD TSO\r\n- This ensures their commit_ts is always greater than min_commit_ts\r\n- Therefore, commit_ts is guaranteed to be greater than resolved-ts\r\n\r\n\r\n",
