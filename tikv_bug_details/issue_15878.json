  "title": "`field` function doesn't consider the collation",
  "body": "Run the following SQL:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndrop table if exists t;\r\ncreate table t(a varchar(10) collate utf8mb4_bin, b varchar(10) collate utf8mb4_general_ci);\r\ninsert into t (a, b) values ('a', 'A');\r\nselect * from t where field('A', a collate utf8mb4_general_ci, b) > 1;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is wrong, because TiKV doesn't use `utf8mb4_general_ci` to compare the string, and so that `a != A`. The expected behavior is that `a == A` and this `SELECT` should return empty.\r\n\r\nRef https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/47688",
