  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nBucket will be re-splitted if its write bytes exceeds half of the bucket size.\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/7692be47d181f0ceb96d904fe7bc485f274e0c1f/components/raftstore/src/store/fsm/peer.rs#L5777-L5781\r\n\r\nHowever, bucket stats is reset on `report_region_buckets_tick`(every 10s), and the split check tick is also 10s. It's very like the re-split doesn't take effect.\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/7692be47d181f0ceb96d904fe7bc485f274e0c1f/components/raftstore/src/store/fsm/peer.rs#L6072 ",
