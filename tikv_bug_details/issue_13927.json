It creates a `ctl-engine-info-log` directory.\r\n\r\nAnd if there is no permission in the current directory, the command will fail.",

      "body": "> Hi I am interested to pick this up. May I ask what is the expected behavior we want to have?\r\n\r\nThe most basic requirement is that we don't have to create the directory when not executing any command. For example, `tikv-ctl --help` or `tikv-ctl --encode some_key`.\r\n\r\nBut a lot of subcommands also don't need these engine logs. So, personally I prefer to defer the creation of engine log directory until necessary.\r\n\r\nThis can be done by wrapping the log `Drain` and create the directory when there is actually something to log. And I think we can allow permission errors if the directory fails to be created. Silently ignoring the error or falling back to stderr are both acceptable to me."
