  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/454faa2e16ac2178078c725d8900ecba6f045955/components/region_cache_memory_engine/src/write_batch.rs#L107-L125\r\n\r\nRocksDB assigns a unique sequence number for every modification, whereas the cache engine reuses the same sequence number. This may result in a Put operation being overshadowed by a Delete if they are in the same write batch. If this happens on the lock column family, it can lead to issues like #17074.\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n\r\nNightly, 2024-06-06\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\nNo need.\r\n",
