It's probably due to configuration are not generated in temporary directory during tests. I can confirm `test_update_raftstore_config` is one of the source that produces file in tests directory.\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nmaster\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nmake test\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nA clean workspace.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\ngit status shows there are dirty untrack files.
