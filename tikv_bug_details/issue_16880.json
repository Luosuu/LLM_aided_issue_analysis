Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nmaster(9b0c9b9c0b1024b0b11543dcffbf11bd9d8fc580)\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\nDoesn't matter.\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\n1. Start a long-running pipelined dml\r\n2. Start other read requests(read ts != maxuint64) that observe one of the locks written by the pipelined-dml\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nThe min_commit_ts is pushed and the locks can be ignored.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nThe read request is blocked.\r\n",
