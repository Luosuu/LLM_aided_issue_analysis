  "title": "coprocessor: parsing error is never returned",
  "body": "When it fails to parse a request, the error is wrapped in an dummy handler which is returned from the function with a fake context and supposed to be executed inside read pool.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/e53a8c21d77d8ce0e06b855fbe31ee9f8cd525a2/src/coprocessor/endpoint.rs#L196-L211\r\n\r\nHowever endpoint will continue to get a snapshot first using the fake context, which will always fail as it's an invalid context.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/e53a8c21d77d8ce0e06b855fbe31ee9f8cd525a2/src/coprocessor/endpoint.rs#L344-L357\r\n\r\nSo a strange error from raftstore is returned instead of the actual error which is the parsing error in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe bug is introduced in #3515, and affects v2.1.x and v3.0.x, needs to be fixed soon.\r\n\r\n@disksing @breeswish PTAL\r\n\r\n",
