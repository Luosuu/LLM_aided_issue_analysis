  "title": "Raft logs in CommitMerge should forward to raftstore first",
  "body": "If a node is panicked when there is a region executing `catch_up_logs_for_merge`, then the node can not restart again, because when it executes `catch_up_logs_for_mrege` it may execute some committed logs that are not yet present in the peer_storage, this will lead to write an applied_index that is higher than the commit_index. When the node restarts it will panic due to applied_index > commit_index.\r\n\r\nWe can forward committed logs to raftstore, and write them to the peer_storage, then ask apply worker to apply the new committed raft logs. \r\n\r\n",
