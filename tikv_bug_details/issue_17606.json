Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nv6.5.9\r\nfcbd1624b4445574af328fe78fbb683de76057c8\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nX86 K8S\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. 07:51 - 07:55 Create 4 CDC clusters (each CDC cluster with 32C CDC nodes), for each CDC cluster create one changefeed,  each changefeed replicating ~40k tables (overall ~160k tables)\r\n2. 07:58 Pause changefeed and update config \r\n3. 08:12 resume all changefeeds\r\n4. 09:38 Pause all changefeed\r\n5. 10:33 delete changefeed (Delete changefeeds from TiDB cloud UI)\r\n6. 10:07 - 10:33 manually kill and restart all TiKV\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n- When task paused, previous pending initial scan task should be cancelled, Otherwise this might block following changefeed initilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nAfter step 1, one changefeed initilization finished (all tables added the changefeed)\r\nAfter step 3, For the initilized changefeed, table count is 0 for 1.4h+ before it was paused.\r\nAfter step 4, initial scan pending tasks is decreasing, but it is very slow.\r\nAfter step 6, the pending tasks disappeared.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f55c340a-4b03-410f-ac61-0c23836ba3bb)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a8a404c-8c94-4107-a740-0610fec418d8)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
