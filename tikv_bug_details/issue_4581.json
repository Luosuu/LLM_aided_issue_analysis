  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nTiKV panics on leader election if `catch_up_log_for_merge` applies a compact log command. Let's say there is a peer truncated_index = 6, applied_index = 7, commit_index = 8, last_index = 10, and the peer is going to be merged into a target. When the target applies a commit_merge command, it will first send a `CatchupLog` task to the peer, after receiving the task, the peer will load entries [9, lastest_commit_index]  and apply them. If there are some compact log commands in these entries, truncated_index will be updated, however, the peer is going to be merged, so applied_index does not update. \r\n\r\nThere is a chance that applied_index = 7 and truncated_index = 9, this leads to panic on leader election.\r\n\r\nThe fix mentioned in #4560 also resolves this bug.\r\n\r\n",
