Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\nv8.0\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\nx86, k8s\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. TiDB cluster with Titan on, huge disk throughtput generated when scalint out TiKV and result in slow store and trigger evict leader schedulers.\r\n2. add TiKV configuration storage.io-rate-limit max-bytes-per-sec = 700MB, and do TiKV scale out again\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nTiKV disk throughtput should be limited as expected.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nio-rate-limit max-bytes-per-sec  seems not working, fron GCP disk metrics we can see there is still 1GB+ write throughtput.\r\n![img_v3_0290_2e27ae26-18b2-493d-872e-f8ed1100cbag](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/7403864/992fc7c3-f6f9-40e8-b5d7-c257f7b2bd07)\r\n![img_v3_0290_38820119-4837-47e7-8fc9-c289708f65fg](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/7403864/ebd22d50-f8c5-4c84-8c94-b834594261bc)\r\n![img_v3_0290_4573e568-3374-4cb5-a808-a53a498b36eg](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/7403864/a21434ba-a770-40e8-90b2-66e5d4b087c2)\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "TiKV IO rate limiter does not restrict IO if it is high priority (by default, when the mode is not `strict`).  This is to avoid traffic turbulence that we have observered after introducing rate limiter with strict rate limiting. https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/6220da547959660bfc607e682109ee814da99e0b/components/file_system/src/rate_limiter.rs#L237-L241\r\nOperations that are performance-critical have high priorities by default:\r\nhttps://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/6220da547959660bfc607e682109ee814da99e0b/src/storage/config.rs#L399-L410\r\n\r\nDue to above reasons, I think the IO was not limited as \"expected\".\r\n<img width=\"1469\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/16486422/820bc019-0e4b-483e-a45e-3f3c363044a2\">\r\n"
