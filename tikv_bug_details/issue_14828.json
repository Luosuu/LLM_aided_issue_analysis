Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\nv6.5.2\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->\r\nNot related\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\nDo not trigger flow control\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\nWhen there is a big region formed for some reason, multiple sst files snapshot may ingest a lot of SSTs in L0 while it only check `ingest_maybe_stall` based on the premise of ingesting only one SST. Then it could be cause too many L0 files and trigger flow control.\r\n\r\n![img_v2_eef732cd-8a61-4d54-83e1-260433fcc54g](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/13497871/29cb26c4-99ff-4fc0-9b58-5167302e5ccf)\r\n![img_v2_b19399c4-a552-42e2-ba3e-5121c915e83g](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/13497871/c4628d3e-9ba4-4632-a144-5318925ab9aa)\r\n![img_v2_c56df2db-8cbd-442a-95e8-56e6a10584cg](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/assets/13497871/30a1e22a-10e4-4454-b652-0cbe845c7a7d)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
