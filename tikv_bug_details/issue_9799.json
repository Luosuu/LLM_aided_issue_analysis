Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->\r\n\r\n```\r\nRelease Version:   5.0.0-rc.x\r\nEdition:           Community\r\nGit Commit Hash:   2d3c66cc44ea19a4e339ec44cf1fcd1477555b7d\r\nGit Commit Branch: master\r\nUTC Build Time:    2021-02-08 09:58:47\r\nRust Version:      rustc 1.51.0-nightly (1d0d76f8d 2021-01-24)\r\nEnable Features:   jemalloc mem-profiling portable sse protobuf-codec test-engines-rocksdb\r\nProfile:           dist_release\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->\r\n\r\n* Large-scale cluster\r\n* For some reasons, PD does not have a leader\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\n* TiKV performs the backoff strategy normally and waits for PD to recover.\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\n* Each Region heartbeat triggers a reconnection with PD. A large number of regions triggers similar DDoS attacks on PD. PD cannot be recovered.\r\n* `[INFO] [util.rs:396] [\"connecting to PD endpoint\"]` Thousands of times per second.",
