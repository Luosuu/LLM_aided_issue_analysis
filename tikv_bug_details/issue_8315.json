Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->\r\n\r\n### What version of TiKV are you using?\r\n\r\nMaster (8faf2601b981f3ac58b902f8a1c0d24ba41b60b1)\r\n\r\n### What operating system and CPU are you using?\r\n\r\nk8s, CPU: require 4, limit 16;  memory require 16G, limit 32G\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Load some data, generate lot of regions\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9948422/88361600-25c5a400-cdac-11ea-83b6-d326011e3b51.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9948422/88361720-92d93980-cdac-11ea-8737-d93c7754efd1.png)\r\n\r\n2. Enable random merge\r\n\r\n3. Wait\r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n\r\nTiKV runs normally\r\n\r\n### What did happened?\r\n\r\nTiKV's memory usage gradually grows up and OOM\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9948422/88361836-ffeccf00-cdac-11ea-9cf5-b606d9c9c243.png)\r\n\r\n...and it's not used by block cache\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9948422/88361861-18f58000-cdad-11ea-8547-09ab3367005f.png)\r\n\r\nI don't know the reason but I'm afraid there are some memory leak.\r\n\r\ncc @BusyJay \r\n\r\n",
