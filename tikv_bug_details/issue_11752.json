There seems to be queueing tasks in GC worker so that `UnsafeDestroyRange` requests takes minutes in gRPC duration.\r\n\r\nWe may consider:\r\n1. Optimize `GcKeys` tasks\r\n2. Make `UnsafeDestroyRange` executes with higher priority to avoid being blocked by `GcKeys` for too long (but in the other way `GcKeys` might be blocked by `UnsafeDestroyRange`).\r\n\r\ncc @hicqu "
