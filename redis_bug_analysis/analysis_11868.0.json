    ],
    "Root Cause": "Timing-related test failure where max latency exceeded expected threshold of 30ms",
    "Detailed Insights": {
      "Test Context": "Active defragmentation performance test",
      "Actual Latency": "> 38ms",
      "Expected Latency": "<= 30ms",
      "Potential Factors": [
        "VM/Test Environment Constraints",
        "Single-core/low-performance system",
        "Potential test threshold sensitivity"
      ]
    },
    "Recommended Actions": [
      "Consider increasing latency threshold",
      "Verify test on multiple system configurations",
      "Review active defragmentation implementation"
