    "Severity": 1,
    "Categories": [
      "CodeBug",
      "Config"
    ],
    "Root Cause": "Terminology confusion in Redis mode reporting - 'standalone' does not mean single instance, but non-clustered mode",
    "Details": {
      "Observed Behavior": "Redis-cli reports 'redis_mode:standalone' even in Sentinel configuration",
      "Expected Behavior": "Consistent mode reporting across Redis and Sentinel CLIs",
      "Impact": "Cosmetic/reporting issue, no functional impact on Redis operation"
    },
    "Resolution": {
      "Official Response": "Not a bug, but potentially confusing terminology",
      "Explanation": "In Redis, 'standalone' refers to non-clustered mode and can include master-replica setups"
    }
  },
  "issue_number": 8656.0,
  "title": "[BUG] Redis-cli INFO says its running in standalone mode even though it is running with Sentinel (6.0.10)"
