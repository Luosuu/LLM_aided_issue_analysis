  "root_cause": "After careful review of the issue and comments, this does not appear to be a definitive bug. The behavior described seems to be expected Redis PubSub functionality, where unsubscribe commands may return 0 if no current subscriptions exist for that specific client. The comments from @ranshid suggest the reported 'issue' is actually standard Redis behavior.",
